       "  'content': 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all hit new all-time highs on Friday after a disappointing November jobs report. Just how much upside could be left? Well, let’s look at a few top stock trades going into next week.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\\n\\nThe action in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is getting very tight.\\n\\nShares hit a new all-time high on Wednesday. Since then, the stock has pulled back a bit but continues to hover near this $94 area. On Monday, I want to see a move over the two-day high at $94.70.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nIf AMD stock can do that, it puts the all-time high in play at $96.37. Above that opens the door to $100. On the downside, though, see that shares hold Friday’s low and the 10-day moving average.\\n\\n7 Cheap Stocks Ready for Big Gains in 2021\\n\\nBelow could put a retest of the breakout level in play, near $88.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Fastly (FSLY) top stock trades for FSLY\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\\n\\nAt one point on Friday, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) was up more than 17%. However, the stock has since pulled back, with shares up “just” 7% to end the day.\\n\\nThe action is discouraging despite the stock’s big gain. From here, I’d like to see Fastly hold up over the 50-day and 100-day moving average confluence, near $86.\\n\\nAbove that, and the stock still looks okay on the long side. If it can take out Friday’s high at $97.19 — which just barely began to fill that huge gap from October — perhaps it can clear $100 and begin to fill more of that gap.\\n\\nBelow the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, and investors will want to see range support hold near $73 to $75.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Big Lots (BIG) top stock trades for BIG\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\\n\\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) went on sale on Friday, falling about 11% on earnings.\\n\\nGapping below the 50-day, shares are trading right into the 100-day moving average. If it holds as support, look for Big Lots to reclaim the 50-day.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAbove, and it could fill the post-earnings gap. If it fills the gap, then $55 resistance is certainly possible.\\n\\n7 Best Cruise Stocks Seeking to Set Sail Again in 2021\\n\\nShould the 100-day moving average fail as support, the November low is on the table at $44.84. Below $42.50, and Big Lots stock could face more selling pressure, perhaps down to the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nTop Trades for Monday No. 4: AT&T (T) top stock trades for T\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\\n\\nSpeaking of the 200-day moving average, AT&T (NYSE:T) is finally making a move above it.\\n\\nShares still continue to trade within that rising wedge pattern though. For now, investors must remain patient, although Friday’s action is encouraging.\\n\\nOn the upside, a break of $30 could kickstart a move to fill the gap toward $31. If filled, the June high at $32.08 is possible.\\n\\nOn the downside, however, look for a close below the 200-day moving average. That could put $28 to $28.50 area in play. Not only will the stock find its 50-day and 100-day moving averages in this zone, but also recent support.\\n\\nTop Trades for Monday No. 5: PagerDuty (PD) top stock trades for PD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\\n\\nLast but not least is PagerDuty (NYSE:PD), which had itself a big day — up more than 26% on Friday.\\n\\nThis stock was already in a steep downtrend coming into 2020, then the coronavirus hammered the share price. Since then, though, it’s been on a huge rally. In early September, disappointing earnings results dropped it from the $37 area.\\n\\nNow, positive earnings are propelling it above this level. The move sent the stock to its highest level since summer 2019.\\n\\nFrom here, I want to see PD hold up over $37. Below, and $35 could be on the table. On the upside, though, let’s see if shares can push up to the $44 to $45 area. That was a key level that PagerDuty lost in August 2019.\\n\\nReclaiming it would put $50-plus back in play.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in T, PD and FSLY.\\n\\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nWhy Everyone Is Investing in 5G All WRONG  Top Stock Picker Reveals His Next 1,000% Winner  Radical New Battery Could Dismantle Oil Markets\\n\\nThe post 5 Top Stock Trades for Monday: AMD, FSLY, BIG, T, PD appeared first on InvestorPlace.',\n",

AMD also provided\\xa0adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release.\\xa0AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\xa0These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables at the end of this earnings press release.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income on investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also included acquisition-related costs for the quarter and the year ended December 26, 2020, and a loss contingency on legal matter for the year ended December 28, 2019. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. **The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.  The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\\n\\nMedia Contact:\\r\\nDrew Prairie\\r\\nAMD Communications\\r\\n512-602-4425\\r\\ndrew.prairie@amd.com\\n\\nInvestor Contact:\\r\\nLaura Graves\\r\\nAMD Investor Relations\\r\\n408-749-5467\\r\\nlaura.graves@amd.com',\n",

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “designed,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements in this communication relate to, among other things, obtaining applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals of, or satisfying the other closing conditions to, the proposed transaction, the expected tax treatment of the transaction, the expected timing of the transaction, and the integration of the businesses and the expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and growth to result therefrom. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. These risks include, among other things: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction or to complete the transaction on anticipated terms and timing; risks that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize expected benefits, cost savings, accretion, synergies and/or growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that disruptions from the transaction will harm business plans and operations; risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration; significant transaction and/or integration costs, or difficulties in connection with the transaction and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities; restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact the ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; litigation associated with the transaction; the potential impact of the consummation of the transaction on AMD’s, Xilinx’s or the combined company’s relationships with suppliers, customers, employers and regulators; and demand for the combined company’s products.

Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result.

       "  'title': 'Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know',\n",
       "  'content': \"In the latest trading session, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $81.05, marking a -0.22% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.59%.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 12.34% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.38% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.71% in that time.\\n\\nInvestors will be hoping for strength from AMD as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.44 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 144.44%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.21 billion, up 79.48% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.93 per share and revenue of $13.47 billion, which would represent changes of +49.61% and +37.94%, respectively, from the prior year.\\n\\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\\n\\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\\n\\nDigging into valuation, AMD currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 42.09. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.6, so we one might conclude that AMD is trading at a premium comparatively.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe can also see that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.33. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

       "  'title': 'AMD: New CPU’s Market Share Gains Could Be Limited to Supply Issues',\n",
       "  'content': \"For the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been a real thorn in Intel’s side, increasingly taking CPU market share away from the historically much bigger rival. In the meantime, the gap has closed, and AMD is now looking to further cement its status in the computer server market.\\n\\nOn Monday, the chip giant launched the 3rd generation EPYC server CPU - code named Milan. Built on TSMC’s 7nm process (same as the second-generation Rome), and featuring AMD's Zen 3 microarchitecture, Milan should display a significantly better instructions per clock (IPC) performance. Cloud, Enterprise and HPC customers should also benefit from Milan’s enhanced security features.\\n\\nMoreover, across certain HPC, Cloud and Enterprise workloads, Milan has displayed more than double the performance capabilities of 14nm Intel server CPUs.\\n\\nAMD believes that this year, across all generations of EPYC, the number of cloud instances will likely double, from 200+ 1st/2nd generation instances to more than 400 instances in total.\\n\\nBy the end of 2021, the company also anticipates 100 new OEM server platforms will be using the third gen EPYC.\\n\\nFollowing the launch, J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur noted, “AMD continues to deliver meaningful improvements to its server CPU platform and appears poised to expand across customers and workloads.”\\n\\nThe analyst added, “We anticipate AMD benefitting from strong market demand and from new workloads on EPYC 3. Based on 3rd party data, AMD had about 8- 9% share of the x86 server CPU market and we believe AMD will likely be on track to gain 2-4 percentage points of market share this year and likely into next year,”\\n\\nThat said, the analyst believes upside could be “limited,” due to industry-wide supply constraints.\\n\\nWhat’s more, Intel is expected to launch its Ice Lake server lineup sometime during the second half of the year, for which Sur anticipates there will “strong demand.” Intel will also have an advantage as it not likely to be supply constrained.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTo this end, Sur sticks to a Neutral (i.e. Hold) rating for AMD shares, alongside a $100 price target. You might as well call Sur’s rating a Buy, however, as the upside here comes in at a decent 21%. (To watch Sur’s track record, click here)\\n\\nOverall, most analysts remain in AMD’s corner; based on 14 Buys vs. 6 holds and 1 Sell, the stock qualifies with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $104 and a change, investors stand to take home 26% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months.

       "  'title': 'AMD Unveils Third-Generation EPYC Processors: Main Takeaways',\n",
       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices AMD recently rolled out the third-generation AMD EPYC processors (codenamed Milan) to further its prospects in the server processor market. The new AMD EPYC 7003 Series CPUs are aimed at improving outcomes for high-performance computing (HPC), cloud and enterprise customers.\\n\\nPer AMD estimates, the new EPYC processors will aid enterprise customers to boost efficacy and performance by improving transactional database processing by up to 19% and providing better performance for flexible Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI).\\n\\nThe latest AMD EPYC 7003 Series processors offer up to 64 “Zen 3” cores per processor. The latest EPYC chips also provide PCIe 4 connectivity and boast new levels of per-core cache memory. Third Generation EPYC processors offer up to 32MB of L3 cache per core.\\n\\nAMD EPYC 7003 Series processors feature AMD Infinity Guard which offers advanced security features to safeguard stored data. The latest EPYC processors are embedded with a new security feature called Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). This feature creates an isolated execution environment by extending Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) capabilities on EPYC processors, thereby thwarting hypervisor-based attacks, noted AMD.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\\n\\nAMD Plans to Expand Partner Ecosystem\\n\\nAMD also added that the company intends to grow the AMD EPYC processor ecosystem considerably by this year-end. By 2021, the chipmaker expects 100 new server platforms to leverage its third generation EPYC processors and more than 400 cloud instances to utilize EPYC processors (all generations).\\n\\nAMD’s partner ecosystem includes names like Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Cisco, Oracle ORCL, VMware, Lenovo, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s Azure platform will utilize AMD EPYC 7003 Series chips for several new virtual machine offerings while AWS will deploy AMD EPYC 7003 Series CPUs to its core Amazon EC2 instance in the upcoming months.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCisco’s latest Cisco Unified Computing System rack server models already utilize AMD EPYC 7003 Series chips.\\n\\nEncouraging EPYC Prospects Bode Well\\n\\nAMD is riding on a robust traction witnessed by its EPYC processors (especially second-generation processors) across virtualized and HCI architecture. The momentum is likely to get a further push by the fast-growing cloud computing market.\\n\\nIn the last reported quarter, AMD’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment’s revenues soared 176% year over year to $1.284 billion, driven by higher semi-custom product revenues and better EPYC server processor sales.\\n\\nThe launch of third-generation processors is expected to further consolidate AMD’s position in the server market, which is dominated by Intel INTC. Also, strength in 7 nanometer-based processors is expected to fortify AMD’s competitive stance in the commercial and server market against Intel.\\n\\nIntel’s chips utilize process technologies that are designed in-house. However, Intel is marred by production delays pertaining to its 7 nm ramp up. Notably, AMD leverages Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 7 nm process technology, which is facilitating it to deliver its advanced 7 nm chips faster to the target market.\\n\\nThis is expected to boost AMD’s revenues in the upcoming days and instill investors’ confidence in the stock. Notably, shares of AMD, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have returned 97% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 128.9%.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nZacks Top 10 Stocks for 2021\\n\\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 best buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2021?\\n\\nLast year's 2020 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio returned gains as high as +386.8%.

       "  'content': 'Although the masses and most of the financial media blame hedge funds for their exorbitant fee structure and disappointing performance, these investors have proved to have great stock picking abilities over the years (that\\'s why their assets under management continue to swell). We believe hedge fund sentiment should serve as a crucial tool of an individual investor’s stock selection process, as it may offer great insights of how the brightest minds of the finance industry feel about specific stocks. After all, these people have access to smartest analysts and expensive data/information sources that individual investors can\\'t match. So should one consider investing in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)? The smart money sentiment can provide an answer to this question.\\n\\nIs Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock a buy or sell? The smart money was taking a bullish view. The number of long hedge fund positions improved by 3 recently. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was in 74 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The all time high for this statistic was previously 71. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that AMD isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings).\\n\\nHedge funds\\' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn\\'t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds\\' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 124 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here).

Now we\\'re going to review the new hedge fund action surrounding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think AMD Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nAt fourth quarter\\'s end, a total of 74 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 4% from the third quarter of 2020. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in AMD over the last 22 quarters. With hedgies\\' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists an \"upper tier\" of notable hedge fund managers who were increasing their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions). Is AMD A Good Stock To Buy?\\n\\nMore specifically, Arrowstreet Capital was the largest shareholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with a stake worth $944.1 million reported as of the end of December. Trailing Arrowstreet Capital was Fisher Asset Management, which amassed a stake valued at $842.2 million. D E Shaw, GQG Partners, and Viking Global were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Andar Capital allocated the biggest weight to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), around 13.23% of its 13F portfolio. Sylebra Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 9.14 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AMD.\\n\\nWith a general bullishness amongst the heavyweights, key hedge funds have jumped into Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) headfirst. Palestra Capital Management, managed by Andrew Immerman and Jeremy Schiffman, established the biggest position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Palestra Capital Management had $153 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. David Fiszel\\'s Honeycomb Asset Management also made a $48.6 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with brand new AMD positions are Wen Han Li\\'s Andar Capital, Frank Fu\\'s CaaS Capital, and Mario Gabelli\\'s GAMCO Investors.\\n\\nLet\\'s also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) but similarly valued. These stocks are TOTAL S.A. (NYSE:TOT), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), Raytheon Technologies Corp (NYSE:RTX), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD). All of these stocks\\' market caps are similar to AMD\\'s market cap.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position TOT,14,980330,-4 BLK,53,1155646,14 RTX,59,2728602,4 NOW,96,6849288,14 HSBC,14,330089,4 INTU,68,4693235,14 TD,22,171021,7 Average,46.6,2415459,7.6 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 46.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $2415 million. That figure was $6689 million in AMD\\'s case. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand TOTAL S.A. (NYSE:TOT) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AMD is 74.6. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we\\'d rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 26 percentage points. These stocks gained 7% in 2021 through March 12th and beat the market again by 1.6 percentage points. Unfortunately AMD wasn\\'t nearly as popular as these 30 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on AMD were disappointed as the stock returned -11.6% since the end of December (through 3/12) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds as many of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

       "  'title': \"AMD launches 'Milan' chip for data centers as battle with Intel intensifies\",\n",
       "  'content': 'By Stephen Nellis\\n\\n(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Monday released a new data center chip aimed at taking away more market share from rival Intel Corp.\\n\\nThe company\\'s \"Milan\" data center processor is faster than Intel\\'s current best data center chips, the company said. Santa Clara, California-based AMD designs the chip but taps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd to fabricate the chip using TSMC\\'s 7-nanometer chipmaking process.\\n\\nThe use of an outside manufacturing partner has helped AMD capitalize on problems at Intel, which has a different strategy of internally making its own chips and has struggled with delays in its most recent generation of factory technology. The \"Milan\" chip and its predecessor have both outperformed Intel\\'s chips, helping AMD gain market share and land customers such as Alphabet Inc\\'s Google.\\n\\nIntel, however, plans to hit back. Analysts expect it to launch its newest \"Ice Lake\" server chip in the coming weeks, which will be the first one made on Intel\\'s 10-nanometer manufacturing technology that is the performance equivalent of TSMC\\'s 7-nanometer technology used for AMD\\'s \"Milan\" chip.\\n\\nRegardless of how the two chips stack up in terms of speed once both have been released, AMD is still expected to have some advantages, such as a higher number of computing cores on each chip, which lets the chip juggle more software applications at a time.\\n\\nDan McNamara, senior vice president and general manager of AMD\\'s server business unit, said he believes the company can hang on to its lead if it continues to integrate feedback from customers into each new generation of chip.\\n\\n\"We\\'re on our third generation of what we believe is a very solid value proposition and leading CPU for the data center. If we continue that cadence of execution, we think we\\'ll stay competitive,\" he said during a press briefing.\\n\\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)',\n",

       "  'content': \"In the latest trading session, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $81.05, marking a -0.22% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.59%.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 12.34% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.38% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.71% in that time.\\n\\nInvestors will be hoping for strength from AMD as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.44 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 144.44%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.21 billion, up 79.48% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.93 per share and revenue of $13.47 billion, which would represent changes of +49.61% and +37.94%, respectively, from the prior year.\\n\\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\\n\\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\\n\\nDigging into valuation, AMD currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 42.09. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.6, so we one might conclude that AMD is trading at a premium comparatively.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe can also see that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.33. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.8 at yesterday's closing price.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 71, putting it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'content': 'Artisan Partners Limited Partnership, a high value-added investment management firm, published its ‘Artisan Mid Cap Fund’ fourth quarter 2020 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. A return of 16.82% was recorded by its Investor Class: ARTMX, 16.87% by its Advisor Class: APDMX, and 16.89% by its Institutional Class: APHMX, in the fourth quarter of 2020, all below its Russell Midcap Growth Benchmark that delivered a 19.02% return and its Russel Midcap Index that was up by 19.91% in the same period. You can view the fund’s top 5 holdings to have a peek at their top bets for 2021.\\n\\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and emphasized their views on the company. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a California-based semiconductor company that currently has a $99.8 billion market capitalization. Since the beginning of the year, AMD delivered a -9.90% return, but its 12-month gains are up by 111.22%. As of March 17, 2021, the stock closed at $82.63 per share.\\n\\nHere is what Artisan Mid Cap Fund has to say about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. in their Q4 2020 investor letter:\\n\\n\"We also exited our positions in Advanced Micro Devices. Our investment campaign in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) began in the second half of 2018, and we have seen a new management team reinvigorate the company’s product portfolio of microprocessors for PCs and servers, graphics processors, and video game consoles. These new, higher-margin products have helped the company partially close its margin gap with peers and capture share from market leader Intel. While we believe there is meaningful runway for further share gains and margin expansion, AMD has appreciated far beyond our mid-cap market cap mandate, and we exited our position.\"\\n\\nIaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOur calculations show that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) does not belong in our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. was in 74 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 71 funds in the third quarter. AMD delivered a -14.68% return in the past 3 months.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe top 10 stocks among hedge funds returned 231.2% between 2015 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 Index ETFs by more than 126 percentage points. We know it sounds unbelievable. You have been dismissing our articles about top hedge fund stocks mostly because you were fed biased information by other media outlets about hedge funds’ poor performance. You could have doubled the size of your nest egg by investing in the top hedge fund stocks instead of dumb S&P 500 ETFs. Here you can watch our video about the top 5 hedge fund stocks right now. All of these stocks had positive returns in 2020.\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) is taking a diametrically opposite stand to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) on putting restrictions on the use of its gaming graphics cards for cryptocurrency mining, PC Gamer reported.\\n\\nWhat Happened: AMD reportedly confirmed that it would not be blocking any workload on its Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics processing units.\\n\\n“We will not be blocking any workload, not just mining for that matter,” said Nish Neelalojanan, product manager at AMD, according to PC Gamer.\\n\\n“First of all, RDNA was designed from the ground up for gaming and RDNA 2 doubles up on this. And what I mean by this is, Infinity Cache and a smaller bus width were carefully chosen to hit a very specific gaming hit rate.”\\n\\nNeelalojanan, however, added a caveat that mining enjoys or scales with higher bandwidth and bus width which means there will be limitations caused by an “architectural level” for it.\\n\\nSee also: How to Buy AMD Stock\\n\\nWhy It Matters: While Nvidia’s 24GB GeForce RTX 3090 GPU can mine Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETHER) at up to 120 MH/s, higher-end RDNA 2 cards based on AMD’s Navi 21 chip can manage 58-64 MH/s, noted PC Gamer. ETH traded 1.61% lower at $1,776.73 at press time.\\n\\nAMD GPU drivers are based on Linux and are all open-source, which raises the question of whether the company could implement a mining block in the first place.\\n\\nLast week, Nvidia said it had inadvertently unlocked ETH mining performance after it updated its drivers for the RTX 3060.\\n\\nNvidia tried to discourage the use of its RTX 3060 GPUs through drivers earlier so they would be 50% less efficient at mining ETH.\\n\\nThe chipmaker estimates that between $100 million and $300 million of its fourth-quarter revenue came from ETH miners.\\n\\nNvidia has introduced a cryptocurrency mining processor, which it said would help miners build “the most efficient data centers while preserving GeForce RTX GPUs for gamers,” but has received criticism over its pricing.\\n\\nPrice Action: AMD shares closed 1.2% higher at $79.06 on Friday and fell 0.3% in the after-hours trading.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.62%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.12%.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 12.03% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.18% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.76% in that time.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.44, up 144.44% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.21 billion, up 79.48% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.93 per share and revenue of $13.47 billion. These totals would mark changes of +49.61% and +37.96%, respectively, from last year.\\n\\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\\n\\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. AMD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\\n\\nDigging into valuation, AMD currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.63. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.11, which means AMD is trading at a premium to the group.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.71 as of yesterday's close.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 70, which puts it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'content': \"For several years now, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has eaten away at Intel’s market dominance in the CPU segment. Intel, however, with a new CEO at the helm, has been devising its comeback program.\\n\\nRecently, the chip giant announced its new IDM (integrated device manufacturer) 2.0 strategy, which includes the launch of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a new foundry business, and a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona. The news was generally well-received and indicated that the struggling semiconductor company was not about to lay down and allow its rivals to grab more market share.\\n\\nHowever, Northland analyst Gus Richard calls Intel’s latest move a “strategic faux pas” that plays right into its CPU rival’s hands.\\n\\n“We do not believe TSMC will relinquish its manufacturing lead to INTC any time soon and process technology leadership drives product leadership and GM higher,” said the 5-star analyst. “INTC expansion into the foundry market will increase AMD as a priority for TSMC and INTC will be persona non grata. For this reason, we expect AMD's market share momentum to continue.”\\n\\nRichard calls TSMC the “undisputed leader in volume and process technology,” and while Intel has said it will keep on manufacturing its chips in-house, it also intends to outsource chip manufacturing to third-party foundries – TSMC included. But the analyst says its decision to re-enter the foundry market and “maintain leading-edge manufacturing capacity” means that catering to its needs will become “low priority” at TSMC once again.\\n\\nIn contrast, as all AMD’s and Xilinx’ – soon to be part of AMD - leading-edge volume is produced at TSMC, more wins for them means more business for TSMC.\\n\\n“This will likely result in AMD getting earlier access to technology and better capacity allocation, cementing the Company's x86 process technology leadership for the foreseeable future,” Richard opined.\\n\\nAs such, Richard reiterated an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMD shares along with a $96 price target. The analyst, therefore, anticipates gains of 24% over the coming months. (To watch Richard’s track record, click here)\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTurning now to the rest of the Street, where AMD has plenty of support. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 16 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells. Going by the $105.55 average price target, shares are expected to be changing hands for ~36% premium a year from now.

       "  'content': \"Investors might want to bet on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\\n\\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\\n\\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\\n\\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Advanced Micro basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\\n\\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\\n\\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\\n\\nFor Advanced Micro, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\\n\\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Advanced Micro\\n\\nThis chipmaker is expected to earn $1.93 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2021, which represents a year-over-year change of 49.6%.\\n\\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Advanced Micro. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.7%.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\\n\\nThe upgrade of Advanced Micro to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"Here's What Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Shareholder Ownership Structure Looks Like\",\n",
       "  'content': \"The big shareholder groups in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have power over the company. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$98b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. In the chart below, we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Advanced Micro Devices.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  ownership-breakdown\\n\\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Advanced Micro Devices?\\n\\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\\n\\nWe can see that Advanced Micro Devices does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Advanced Micro Devices, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\\n\\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Advanced Micro Devices. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\\n\\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\\n\\nInsider Ownership Of Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\\n\\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\\n\\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$502m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\\n\\nGeneral Public Ownership\\n\\nThe general public holds a 23% stake in Advanced Micro Devices. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\\n\\nNext Steps:\\n\\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for Advanced Micro Devices you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.\\n\\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\\n\\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.36% gain on the day.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 4.94% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.06% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.21% in that time.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.44 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 144.44%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.21 billion, up 79.48% from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.93 per share and revenue of $13.47 billion. These totals would mark changes of +49.61% and +37.96%, respectively, from last year.\\n\\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\\n\\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\\n\\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that AMD has a Forward P/E ratio of 40.7 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.92.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe can also see that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.29. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.87 at yesterday's closing price.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 109, which puts it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'title': '3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Advanced Micro (AMD)',\n",
       "  'content': \"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\\n\\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\\n\\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\\n\\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\\n\\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this chipmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 90.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 50.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 40.8%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 13.5%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8.1%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Advanced Micro have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.1% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAdvanced Micro has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination positions Advanced Micro well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices AMD is set to release first-quarter 2021 results on Apr 27.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company projects first-quarter 2021 revenues to be around $3.2 billion (+/-$100 million). Robust sales across all its businesses are likely to drive year-over-year increase in revenues. On a sequential basis, revenues are expected to register a decline of 1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.21 billion, suggesting growth of 79.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 44 cents per share. The figure indicates an improvement of 144.4% on a year-over-year basis.\\n\\nFactors Likely to Have Influenced Q1\\n\\nAMD’s first-quarter 2021 performance is expected to have benefitted from strength seen in AMD’s EPYC processors. EPYC processors have been witnessing robust adoption among the cloud, enterprise, and high-performance computing (HPC) customers. The strength in its EPYC processors might have positively impacted server revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, the chipmaker is also likely to gain from the steady momentum witnessed in the adoption of Ryzen, Radeon and semi-custom processors. These processors are being heavily utilized in the cloud, gaming, PC, and data center verticals, driven by work-from-home and online schooling trends due to the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD expects semi-custom revenues to benefit on higher production induced by strong demand for Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 gaming consoles. Both the next-generation hardware consoles were released in November 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing demand for AMD's processor chips augurs well for the top line and instills investors’ confidence in the stock. Shares of the company, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), have returned 41.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 72.6%.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkedly, improving PC shipments’ trend in the first quarter of 2021, driven by increased demand is expected to have favored AMD’s first-quarter performance. Per an IDC report, PC shipments surged 55.2% to 84 million units in the first quarter of calendar year 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent strength in demand for Ryzen 4000 processors in the mobile domain is expected to have contributed to top-line growth in the Computing and Graphics division. In January 2021, at CES 2021, AMD unveiled a new class of mobile processors — AMD Ryzen 5000 Series — based on Zen 3 core architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyzen PRO processors are also anticipated to have witnessed incremental adoption across leading OEMs in the first quarter\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the said quarter, AMD’s Data Center GPU sales are likely to have benefited from healthy demand for AMD Instinct MI100 accelerator.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, increasing expenses on product development amid intensifying competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC is likely to limit margin expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nKey Developments in Q1\\n\\nIn March 2021, AMD launched AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card, which is built on the company’s RDNA 2 gaming architecture. The graphics card is based on the 7 nanometer (nm) process technology and is aimed toward augmenting PC video gaming experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, AMD rolled out the third-generation AMD EPYC processors (dubbed Milan) to boost its prospects in the server processor market. The new AMD EPYC 7003 Series CPUs are designed to improve outcomes for HPC, cloud and enterprise customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company also unveiled AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 Series mobile processors based on its Zen 3 core architecture. The new line of Ryzen Pro mobile processors is aimed toward enhancing efficiency of professional laptops amid rise in hybrid work set-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, AMD and Xilinx XLNX stockholders unanimously approved the acquisition of Xilinx by AMD. The transaction, subject to regulatory and customary approvals, is slated for completion by the end of 2021.\\n\\nZacks Top 10 Stocks for 2021\\n\\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 best buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2021?\\n\\nLast year's 2020 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio returned gains as high as +386.8%.

AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2021, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables at the end of this earnings press release.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income on investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also included acquisition-related costs for the quarter ended March 27, 2021 and December 26, 2020. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.',\n",

       "  'title': 'AMD Gives Bullish Forecast, Raises 2021 Revenue Outlook',\n",
       "  'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave a strong second-quarter sales forecast indicating the chipmaker is taking market share from Intel Corp. amid robust demand for personal computers and servers.\\n\\nSecond-quarter revenue will be about $3.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million, in the period ending in June, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $3.28 billion.Investors have poured money into the stock, betting that new products, including its Epyc server chips, and stumbles by Intel present an opportunity for AMD. Intel reported data-center revenue that dropped 20% in the first quarter, leading many analysts to project that it was losing sales to its smaller rival in the most profitable part of the market for computer processors. AMD said its server business surged in the quarter.\\n\\n“We delivered another quarter of record server-processor revenue, as Epyc processor sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told analysts on a conference call. “We expect data center product revenue to grow significantly as we go through the year, driven by our strong pipeline of new cloud, enterprise and HPC (high-performance computing) wins.”\\n\\nThree months ago she forecast that the company’s revenue would grow 37% this year. On Tuesday, AMD lifted that prediction to a 50% gain in 2021. Prior to the call, Wall St. had been projecting an annual gain of 39%.\\n\\nThe bullish outlook has prompted questions about whether AMD can get enough chips to meet demand amid industry-wide shortages at the company’s outsourced manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Su said the company has ‘good visibility’ to additional supply coming in the second half that supports the company’s improved forecast for the balance of the year.\\n\\nAMD competes with Intel in processors for personal computers and servers and has struggled to get more than 20% market share for much of the 50 years they’ve been competing. It also supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation and competes with Nvidia Corp. in PC GPUs.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLast week, Intel’s report caused a slump in its shares. Executives pinned the large decline in Intel’s data center business on a slowdown in orders by companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS that are working through stockpiles of chips before ordering more, they said.\\n\\nAMD reported first-quarter net income of $555 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 14 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 93% to $3.45 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 52 cents. Analysts were looking for profit of 44 cents on sales of $3.21 billion.AMD shares rose about 4% in extended trading after closing at $85.21. The stock has slipped 7% this year, paring a surge over the last five years. It ended 2015 at $2.87.\\n\\n(Updates with CEO comments from fourth paragraph.)\\n\\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\\n\\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.44 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of 10.64%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $3.45 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.46%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.79 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro shares have lost about 6.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.5%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Advanced Micro?\\n\\nWhile Advanced Micro has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.45 on $3.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.95 on $13.53 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\\n\\nHikes ‘21 Revenue Guidance, Shares Up\\n\\nFollowing stellar first-quarter 2021 results and encouraging outlook for second-quarter 2021 and raised revenue projections for 2021, shares of AMD, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), are up more than 4.5% in the pre-market trading on Apr 28. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD expects second-quarter 2021 revenues to be $3.6 billion (+/-$100 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 86% and quarter-over-quarter improvement of 4%. For second-quarter 2021, AMD expects robust sales across all its businesses to drive year-over-year increase in revenues. Meanwhile, the sequential increase is projected to be led by growth across data center and gaming verticals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.28 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 47%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $900 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2021, management now expects revenues to increase 50% year over year, compared with prior projected growth of 37%, encouraged by improvement across all its businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 revenues is pegged at $13.53 billion, which suggests year-over-year growth of 38.5%.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the company continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2021 to be 47%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are anticipated to be 26% of total revenues.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSegmental Details\\n\\nComputing and Graphics segment’s (61% of total revenues) revenues of $2.1 billion, increased 46% year over year and 7% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to robust adoption of Ryzen and Radeon processors, and higher revenues from client processor and graphics sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nClient processor average selling price (ASP) was record high as client computing revenues grew in double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis and improved sequentially. The increase was driven by a favorable mix of Ryzen desktop and notebook processor sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home and online learning wave continued to drive PC market strength, which led to robust growth in client processor revenues especially across ultrathin, gaming, and commercial segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering notebooks, AMD delivered sixth straight quarter of record mobile processor revenues driven by persistent demand for Ryzen 4000 Series processors and incremental adoption of newly launched Ryzen 5000 Series processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement noted that Ryzen Mobile 5000 Series processor raked in revenues twice as fast as the prior generation. Momentum is expected to continue through 2021 as the number of notebook platforms powered by new processors is on track to increase by 50% compared to the prior generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the commercial market, Ryzen PRO Processors’ unit shipments improved by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. The company clinched multiple high-volume wins across Fortune 500 companies across aerospace, automotive, electronics, and engineering domains in the first quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement was elated as the company tripled commercial notebook design wins across the largest OEMs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn graphics, revenues surged in double-digit percentage both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, courtesy of channel sales growth driven by solid uptick in high-end Radeon 6000 GPUs, revenues from which more than doubled from the prior quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the company rolled out Radeon 6700 XT desktop GPU with leading 1440p gaming performance and remains on track for the first notebooks featuring the latest leading-edge mobile RDNA 2 architecture and 7 nanometer (nm) process technology to launch later in second quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, AMD anticipates Radeon 6000 Series GPU sales to grow significantly over the coming quarters as production ramps up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company noted that Data Center GPU business improved on a year-over-year basis as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis, backed by growing clout of Instinct accelerators across cloud and HPC customers. GPU ASP was higher both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, owing to strong uptake of high-end Radeon graphics products.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraction witnessed across AMD Instinct MI100 accelerator chips is noteworthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company also added that it is working on commencing the production ramp of AMD Instinct GPU to support the launch of Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer; as well as various other HPC deal wins.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment’s (39% of total revenues) revenues of $1.345 billion were up 286% year over year and 5% sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year-over-year increase can be attributed to higher semi-custom product sales and EPYC processor revenues. The sequential increase was led by higher EPYC processor sales, which was partially offset by lower semi-custom product sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemi-custom revenues declined by a single-digit percentage sequentially, which per management fared better than typical seasonality. The company anticipates semi-custom sales to remain strong through 2021, courtesy of robust demand for the latest gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft MSFT.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn server domain, AMD witnessed sequential increase in both second and third generation EPYC processors. Growing adoption of second generation solutions was complemented by third generation EPYC processors, which are successfully ramping into production amid new deal wins from major enterprise, cloud, and HPC companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD noted record server processor revenues as EPYC processor sales more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and grew by a strong double-digit percentage on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkedly, third generation EPYC processors offer 25% more performance per watt compared to previous generation and offers leading per core and per socket performance, across database, ERP, data analytics, Java, virtualization, cloud, and supercomputing workloads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cloud vertical, AMD highlighted that demand was strong following the roll out of 11 new AMD-based public cloud instances in the reported quarter by major Tier 1 cloud providers, as they expanded their EPYC processor deployments to power more of their internal infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement expects the number of AMD-powered instances to double by the end of the year to hit 400 as Microsoft Azure, Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Tencent Cloud significantly expand their offerings with third generation EPYC processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD’s focus on introducing new high-performance EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs to support complex applications, advanced modeling, database and hyper-converged workloads are driving growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn enterprise domain, the company’s servers are witnessing rapid uptake as companies like Cisco CSCO, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro, continue to expand their AMD-based offerings with more than 100 new third generation EPYC processor-powered server platforms that deliver enhanced performance and total cost of ownership (TCO).\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, management is optimistic on increasing utilization of AMD CPUs and GPUs across supercomputing systems. In HPC domain, the company clinched new high-volume wins, including Sweden's Institute of Science, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and an exclusive on-prem and cloud solution for the U.K.'s National Weather Modeling Service, which is touted to be the world's most powerful weather and climate forecasting supercomputer.\\n\\nOperating Details\\n\\nNon-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged at 46% on a year-over-year basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 42% year over year to $830 million, due to higher investments in Research & development (R&D) and go-to-market initiatives along with increased variable employee compensation-related costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nR&D expenses rose 38% year over year to $610 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses surged 60.3% year over year to $319 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses were 24%, contracting 900 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter’s levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjusted EBITDA soared 181.9% year over year to $857 million. The upside can be attributed to earnings growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP operating income totaled $752 million, up 223% year over year. Growth in revenue base drove year-over-year improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 22% expanded 900 bps year over year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSegment wise, Computing and Graphics operating income was $485 million (23% of segment revenue) up 85% year over year, courtesy of higher revenues. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $277 million (21% of segment revenue) against operating loss of $26 million reported in the year-ago quarter, owing to higher revenues.\\n\\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\\n\\nAs of Mar 27, 2021, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $3.116 billion compared with $2.29 billion as of Dec 26, 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of Mar 27, 2021, total debt (long-term plus short-term) was $314 million, down from $338 million as of Dec 26, 2020. This includes a $24 million reduction in the company’s 2026 convertible notes, which have only $2 million remaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperating cash flow was reported at $898 million compared with $554 million in fourth-quarter 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree cash flow was $832 million in the first quarter compared with $480 million in fourth-quarter 2020.\\n\\nZacks Names “Single Best Pick to Double”\\n\\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2021, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables at the end of this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of April 27, 2021 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income on investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also included acquisition-related costs for the quarter ended March 27, 2021 and December 26, 2020. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.',\n",

       "  'content': 'AMD CEO Lisa Su is staying very bullish on the outlook for the semiconductor industry as more workloads move into the cloud and workers embrace the hybrid workplace lifestyle.\\n\\nSweetening the case fo the chip space: strong pricing power amid the ongoing shortage of chips that is roiling from global auto production to e-cigarette manufacturing.\\n\\n\"This is a very unique time in the semiconductor market in which I think people are just realizing how important chips are to every part of our lives. Frankly, that\\'s why I am in this business. It\\'s really humbling to know that the chips we are building are so important no matter who you are and what you are trying to do,\" Su told Yahoo Finance Live. Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD, attends the opening bell at Nasdaq, in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\\n\\nThe favorable industry dynamics powered AMD to another impressive quarter this week, aided by a product portfolio that Su said is the company\\'s best ever.\\n\\nAMD\\'s first quarter non-GAAP net sales surged 93% year-over-year. Operating profits spiked 223% from a year ago. Sales for AMD\\'s lucrative data center business more than doubled year-over-year.\\n\\nHere is how AMD performed compared to Wall Street estimates for the first quarter:\\n\\nNet Sales: $3.45 billion vs. $3.18 billion Adjusted Diluted EPS: $0.52 vs. $0.44\\n\\nAMD lifted its full-year sales growth outlook to 50% from 37% previously.

       "  'title': 'Should Investors Buy The Dip In AMD?',\n",
       "  'content': \"For a company that’s known for explosive growth, 2021 has been a relatively disappointing year for semiconductor player Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Considering the share price is up an astounding 2,198% over the last five years, it is disconcerting to have witnessed an 11%-plus drop since 2021 kicked off.\\n\\nThat raises the question, should investors buy the dip or head for the exits?\\n\\nFierce CompetitionIn The Sector\\n\\nMuch of AMD's recent progress has been at the expense of its competitor, Intel (INTC). At the same time, developments related to INTC account for some of the recent weakness in AMD. Intel recorded a small gain in the CPU market in the fourth quarter, and new CEO Pat Gelsinger is viewed by many as the right man to turn Intel around.\\n\\nAMD is also facing renewed competition from NVIDIA (NVDA). In the middle of this month, NVIDIA introduced the Grace CPU chip. Designed specifically for use in data centers, NVIDIA claims Grace will deliver ten times the current performance on servers devoted to artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. Moreover, NVIDIA’S graphics processing units (GPUs) were adding market share even before Grace's debut.\\n\\nRobust GrowthAt AMD\\n\\nEven so, AMD posted stellar quarterly numbers this week, and there are reasons to believe the firm will experience robust growth for the foreseeable future. The company reported a 93% increase in net revenue year-over-year.\\n\\nDigging deeper, its Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 46% year-over-year, and its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue grew 286% year-over-year. (See Advanced Micro Devices stock analysis on TipRanks)\\n\\nPlus, at a time when many in the semiconductor industry were plagued with chip shortages, AMD reported a jump in inventory, with an increase from $1.4 billion in the previous quarter to $1.7 billion currently.\\n\\nAMD also boasts a strong balance sheet, with cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $3.1 billion. Its long-term debt is at $313 million.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWall Street Weighs In\\n\\nFollowing the earnings call, Raymond Janes analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of AMD with an Outperform rating and a price target of $100. Caso predicts AMD will retain an advantage in CPUs through at least 2024.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, additional analysts boosted their prices for the stock, with the average analyst price target of $106.14 implying 30% upside potential. According to TipRanks' consensus breakdown, 9 analysts have recommended a Buy, 6 have rated it a Hold, and 1 rates it a Sell.\\n\\nUpbeat Industry Projection\\n\\nPerhaps of greatest importance, particularly for those concerned with the company’s growth trajectory, is management’s guidance for revenue growth of 50% in 2020. That represents an increase from prior guidance of approximately 37%.\\n\\nOne reason behind the upbeat projection is an expectation of growth in the data center, personal computer and video gaming markets.\\n\\nAccording to a study by EMR, the latter is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2021 through 2026. Meanwhile, a study by MarketersMEDIA projects a CAGR of 4.8% for the data center server market from 2020 through 2025, and IDC forecasts 18.2% growth in the global PC market in 2021.\\n\\nXilinx PurchaseA Boon To AMD\\n\\nLate last year, AMD reached an agreement to buy Xilinx (XLNX). Expected to close late this year, the acquisition will increase overall sales by a third. The deal should also strengthen AMD’s presence in the data center chip market.\\n\\nWhile AMD’s forward P/E ratio of 30.46 may cause some to pause, it stands as one of the lowest P/E multiples for the company since late 2017. As a matter of fact, during most of the last decade, the company’s P/E ratio has been at least two times that figure.\\n\\nAMD’s PEG ratio of 1.41, which is well below the sector average of 2.08, indicates the shares are likely trading for a significant discount.\\n\\nAn evaluation of the stock presents a reasonable likelihood of continued growth for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the acquisition of Xilinx, along with the firm’s strong financial foundation, supports the argument for investing in AMD.\\n\\nConcluding Thoughts\\n\\nFor those who give credence to management’s growth projections, the recent sell-off in the shares represents an opportunity to grab a high growth stock at a relatively reasonable valuation.\\n\\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Chuck Walston had a position in AMD.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

       "  'title': 'These 4 Measures Indicate That Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Is Using Debt Safely',\n",
       "  'content': \"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\\n\\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\\n\\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nWhat Is Advanced Micro Devices's Debt?\\n\\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Advanced Micro Devices had US$272.0m of debt in March 2021, down from US$488.0m, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$3.12b in cash, leading to a US$2.84b net cash position. debt-equity-history-analysis\\n\\nHow Healthy Is Advanced Micro Devices' Balance Sheet?\\n\\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Advanced Micro Devices had liabilities of US$2.86b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$706.0m due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.12b as well as receivables valued at US$2.19b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$1.73b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHaving regard to Advanced Micro Devices' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$95.4b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, Advanced Micro Devices boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\\n\\nBetter yet, Advanced Micro Devices grew its EBIT by 143% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Advanced Micro Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\\n\\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Advanced Micro Devices has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Advanced Micro Devices recorded free cash flow worth 63% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\\n\\nSumming up\\n\\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Advanced Micro Devices has US$2.84b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 143% over the last year. So is Advanced Micro Devices's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Advanced Micro Devices  (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.\\n\\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this freelist of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

       "  'title': 'Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why Advanced Micro (AMD) is a Solid Choice',\n",
       "  'content': \"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\\n\\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\\n\\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\\n\\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this chipmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 95.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 66.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 44%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 13.5%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Advanced Micro have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 11.4% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAdvanced Micro has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination positions Advanced Micro well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&P 500's 1.04% loss on the day.\\n\\nComing into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 5.45% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.67%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.83%.\\n\\nIn that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.54 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 200%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.61 billion, up 86.86% from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.14 per share and revenue of $14.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +65.89% and +50.46%, respectively, from last year.\\n\\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\\n\\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 11.36% higher. AMD is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\\n\\nInvestors should also note AMD's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 36.75. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.28, so we one might conclude that AMD is trading at a premium comparatively.\\n\\nWe can also see that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.05. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as of yesterday's close.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 92, which puts it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\\n\\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.

With all of that in mind, let’s look at some top stock trades for Friday.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA) Top stock trades for TSLA\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been stalling lately, working on its fourth-straight daily decline and its eighth decline in the past nine trading sessions. CEO Elon Musk’s comments toward Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) don’t seem to be helping either.\\n\\nIn any regard, shares are breaking below this week’s low, as well as the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThis would be a natural spot for bulls to push for a reversal and given the bounce we’re seeing from the lows, it’s clear that’s what they’re trying to do. If they can, look for Tesla to reclaim the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nConfirmation would come on a daily-up reversal over Thursday’s high.\\n\\n7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List\\n\\nIf they can’t trigger a reversal, Tesla may need to go lower. In that case, let’s see if we get a test of the March lows near $539 and a test of the 50-week moving average. If that doesn’t provide a bounce, the $500 breakout area may be in play.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to do well from a business standpoint, but unfortunately, nobody really cares about that right now. AMD is considered a growth stock, and growth stocks are getting slammed.\\n\\nShares are testing into — and are actually breaking below — range support near $74. I would love to see the stock hold this mark by the end of the week. If it doesn’t, it runs the risk of becoming resistance.\\n\\nA notable move lower could put the 21-week moving average in play. On a rebound back over $74, look for AMD stock to test into the 10-week moving average, then challenge $80.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAbove all of these marks puts $87 on the table.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Canada Goose (GOOS) Top stock trades for GOOS\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nCanada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) is getting hit hard on Thursday, down almost 9% after reporting earnings. The stock has faded below a number of key moving averages and knifed right through its 21-week moving average on the day.\\n\\nHowever, it’s finding buyers at the April lows. If this area ends up holding, I want to see GOOS stock reclaim its 21-week moving average. If it can do that, buyers can consider a long position against the post-earnings low.\\n\\nBack above $40 and its 10-week and 50-day moving averages are some reasonable upside targets.\\n\\n7 Safe Stocks to Buy as Janet Yellen Talks Rate Hikes\\n\\nHowever, if Canada Goose fails to hold the April low and pushes lower, the gap-fill near $36 and the 200-day moving average may be in the cards. Stay nimble and remain open-minded here.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Sonos (SONO) Top stock trades for SONO\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nSonos (NASDAQ:SONO) is also on the move after earnings, up more than 7% on the day. However, it’s been a wild mover on Thursday.\\n\\nThere’s good and bad with this chart. For instance, the stock filled its gap at $32.88 earlier this week. However, it then broke below that low with Wednesday’s decline.\\n\\nBut then on Thursday shares went daily-up and undid a lot of damage. Then the stock faded from the highs, though.\\n\\nLike I said, it’s a mixed bag here.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the stock is well off the lows. Unfortunately, though, Thursday’s fade came from a notable area. Specifically, the $35 area continues to act as resistance, while the 21-week moving average didn’t do SONO stock any favors. This area was also strong support earlier this year and it was the breakdown spot this week.\\n\\nI want to see Sonos reclaim $35 before trusting on the long side. If it does, we have a nice low to measure against.\\n\\nIf the stock doesn’t reclaim $35 and breaks that low, it could put another gap-fill in play near $28, followed by the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

       "  'title': 'AMD CEO Lisa Su Says Chipmaker’s Path Gets Tougher From Here',\n",
       "  'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, who took the helm in 2014, has returned the chipmaker to profitability, taken market share from Intel Corp. and banished concerns about the company running out of cash.\\n\\nMore than six years into her tenure, AMD has seen its market value surge to more than $90 billion from about $2 billion when Su was named CEO. On Wednesday, the company unveiled a $4 billion stock-repurchase plan, its first buyback since 2001, highlighting its new financial heft and stability. Still, Su isn’t ready to take a victory lap.“Without a doubt it does not get easier,” Su said in an interview with Bloomberg Technology’s Emily Chang. “We’re in a very competitive market. We have big ambitions about what we want to be able to do.”Su’s AMD has gone from an also-ran chipmaker offering cheaper alternatives to Intel products to a respected provider of computer processors that win orders based on superior performance. Su, the first woman to become CEO of a major chip company, said her main accomplishment has been earning AMD a new reputation for delivering on its promises. She has won customers’ trust that AMD can consistently supply improving products, she said.The executive has restored AMD’s reputation and performance at a critical juncture for the industry. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated demand for remote computing via the internet and for devices needed to support study and work at home. And all this came during a period when Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, had struggled to improve its manufacturing technology, one of the foundations of its decades-long dominance of the computer industry.\\n\\nSu said recent chip shortages, which have hamstrung multiple industries as the world economy comes back to life, are not a disaster -- they’re just another example of the periodic imbalances between supply and demand in the semiconductor market. One silver lining for the chip industry is that it has made customers more open to longer-term commitments.“Normally everybody sort of plans their worlds separately, and now we’re really having to plan our worlds together,” she said.She predicts supply of AMD chips, which are built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will improve throughout 2021.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\\n\\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Stocks opened notably lower on the day as we saw a collapse in the price of cryptocurrencies. However, many made strong recoveries on the day and stocks rallied off the lows. Let’s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Ethereum (ETH-USD) Top stock trades for Ethereum\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nEthereum (CCC:ETH-USD) had been on a powerful rally not that long ago. However, it’s been under pressure since topping out earlier this month and then finally broke down on Wednesday.\\n\\nAt the session low, Ethereum was down 37% today! However, from the lows, it’s actually up 40%, curbing its one-day losses to “just” 23% at the moment. The volatility has been wild, to say the least.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nNow back above the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, bulls need to see Ethereum hold above these measures. At the very least, it has to hold above $2,550.\\n\\nIf ETH loses the $2,500 mark, we can’t rule out a return to this week’s low. Luckily, shares caught a bounce right where we had the breakout marked, near $2,000.\\n\\n7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now\\n\\nOn the upside, however, let’s see how Ethereum does on a test of its 10-day moving average. Above it could put the $3,500 mark and the 21-day moving average in play.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been range bound since last summer, although $74 continues to hold as support.\\n\\nOn the upside, we want to see a rally back to $80, where AMD stock will find its 10-week and 50-week moving averages. Above these measures puts the 21-week on the table, followed by resistance at $88.\\n\\nOn a break below last week’s low at $72.50, it’s possible we see a move lower. In that scenario, keep an eye on the 21-month moving average. If for some reason AMD stock breaks below that measure, the $60 breakout level could be in play.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Target (TGT) Top stock trades for TGT\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nWhile other retailers have struggled despite strong earnings results, Target (NYSE:TGT) is doing quite well.\\n\\nShares are pushing higher on Wednesday, running into its prior highs. From here I’d love to see a push up to the 161.8% extension near $220. Above that puts the two-times range extension at $233 in play.\\n\\n7 Blue-Chip Stocks Looking Better Than Ever\\n\\nOn the downside, though, keep an eye on $210. Losing that mark likely puts it below the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, and puts the 10-week and 50-day moving averages on the table. For now, bulls are in control with this one.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: TJX Companies (TJX) Top stock trades for TJX\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nUnlike Target, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is not responding well to earnings. However, that’s not the end of the world, either.\\n\\nShares are trading right down into the 21-week moving average, a measure that has been support all year. If it holds, look to see if TJX stock can reclaim the 10-week.\\n\\nIf it fails to do so, it’s possible we see a retest of the pre-coronavirus highs near $65, with more support sitting in the low $60s.\\n\\nBack above $71, and TJX stock could retest the all-time highs.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: JD.com (JD) Top stock trades for JD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) was trading really well coming into 2021, but like other growth stocks, it has struggled mightily since topping out in mid-February.\\n\\nAfter cascading lower, JD stock quickly saw its short-term moving averages turn from support to resistance, while it failed to reclaim $85. This combination should have kept bulls out of the name.\\n\\nThen it failed to hold the $78 to $79 area and 50-week moving average, which also turned to resistance. Are you sensing a pattern?\\n\\nNow trying to hold last week’s low near $66.50, let’s navigate this one. On the upside, see how JD stock does on a retest of the $77 to $80 area, if it can get there. There it finds current resistance, but it also finds the 10-day, 10-month and 50-week moving averages.\\n\\nA close below $66.50 likely puts the 21-month moving average and the $60 area in play.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

Not according to the semiconductor giant. In fact, going by the company’s latest actions, quite the opposite.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, AMD announced an unprecedented share-repurchase program. Over an unspecified period, the company will buy back $4 billion’s worth of stock - funded in its entirety by cash generated from operations.\\n\\nAnd the company is sitting on plenty of it by now.

       "  'content': 'After falling in three-straight sessions despite new all-time highs on Monday, equities found their footing and rallied on Thursday. Will the momentum last into the weekend or is it just a dead-cat bounce? With all of that in mind, let’s look at some top stock trades for Friday.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA) Top stock trades for TSLA\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been stalling lately, working on its fourth-straight daily decline and its eighth decline in the past nine trading sessions. CEO Elon Musk’s comments toward Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) don’t seem to be helping either.\\n\\nIn any regard, shares are breaking below this week’s low, as well as the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThis would be a natural spot for bulls to push for a reversal and given the bounce we’re seeing from the lows, it’s clear that’s what they’re trying to do. If they can, look for Tesla to reclaim the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nConfirmation would come on a daily-up reversal over Thursday’s high.\\n\\n7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List\\n\\nIf they can’t trigger a reversal, Tesla may need to go lower. In that case, let’s see if we get a test of the March lows near $539 and a test of the 50-week moving average. If that doesn’t provide a bounce, the $500 breakout area may be in play.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: AMD (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to do well from a business standpoint, but unfortunately, nobody really cares about that right now. AMD is considered a growth stock, and growth stocks are getting slammed.\\n\\nShares are testing into — and are actually breaking below — range support near $74. I would love to see the stock hold this mark by the end of the week. If it doesn’t, it runs the risk of becoming resistance.\\n\\nA notable move lower could put the 21-week moving average in play. On a rebound back over $74, look for AMD stock to test into the 10-week moving average, then challenge $80.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAbove all of these marks puts $87 on the table.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Canada Goose (GOOS) Top stock trades for GOOS\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nCanada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) is getting hit hard on Thursday, down almost 9% after reporting earnings. The stock has faded below a number of key moving averages and knifed right through its 21-week moving average on the day.\\n\\nHowever, it’s finding buyers at the April lows. If this area ends up holding, I want to see GOOS stock reclaim its 21-week moving average. If it can do that, buyers can consider a long position against the post-earnings low.\\n\\nBack above $40 and its 10-week and 50-day moving averages are some reasonable upside targets.\\n\\n7 Safe Stocks to Buy as Janet Yellen Talks Rate Hikes\\n\\nHowever, if Canada Goose fails to hold the April low and pushes lower, the gap-fill near $36 and the 200-day moving average may be in the cards. Stay nimble and remain open-minded here.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Sonos (SONO) Top stock trades for SONO\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nSonos (NASDAQ:SONO) is also on the move after earnings, up more than 7% on the day. However, it’s been a wild mover on Thursday.\\n\\nThere’s good and bad with this chart. For instance, the stock filled its gap at $32.88 earlier this week. However, it then broke below that low with Wednesday’s decline.\\n\\nBut then on Thursday shares went daily-up and undid a lot of damage. Then the stock faded from the highs, though.\\n\\nLike I said, it’s a mixed bag here.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the stock is well off the lows. Unfortunately, though, Thursday’s fade came from a notable area. Specifically, the $35 area continues to act as resistance, while the 21-week moving average didn’t do SONO stock any favors. This area was also strong support earlier this year and it was the breakdown spot this week.\\n\\nI want to see Sonos reclaim $35 before trusting on the long side. If it does, we have a nice low to measure against.\\n\\nIf the stock doesn’t reclaim $35 and breaks that low, it could put another gap-fill in play near $28, followed by the 200-day moving average.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD.

       "  'title': 'Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Advanced Micro (AMD) Now',\n",
       "  'content': \"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\\n\\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\\n\\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\\n\\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this chipmaker a great growth pick right now.\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 95.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 66.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 49.7%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 13.1%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

       "  'title': 'Watch Out Intel, AMD Is Getting Closer',\n",
       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has gone from strength to strength in recent years. While the company has become a giant in the semiconductor industry, it has also been incrementally eating away at its traditionally much bigger rival Intel’s dominance.\\n\\nThe wide gap has begun to close between the two companies and Northland analyst Gus Richard thinks it is about to get narrower still.\\n\\n“We expect by CY22 AMD will be 30% the size of INTC, up from 9.2% in CY18,” the 5-star analyst said. “We expect the delta between INTC and AMD GM will decrease by 13.1% during this period. Also, we estimate that AMD's GM to exceed INTC's in CY23. AMD’s market share gains are likely to continue in 2H:21 and CY22 driven by corporate client and server.”\\n\\nRichard expects AMD will have a “strong” Q2, but the analyst also points out that as the economy reopens, it is very likely the outsized demand for PCs seen during the pandemic era will fade.\\n\\nSo, bad news for AMD, right? Not necessarily. Simply put, Richard thinks AMD’s recent products are better than Intel’s, and due to its competitor’s missteps, AMD has been making inroads with a hard-to-crack client base – corporate customers.\\n\\nIntel’s 14nm and 10nm shortages gave AMD a way into the corporate market, which the company can now build on.\\n\\n“We estimate that AMD currently has a 5% to 7% share of the higher-margin corporate client market and expect its share to accelerate as corporations dual source,” the analyst noted.\\n\\nThere is also increasing evidence, says Richard, that Intel is more focused on “low-end” Chromebooks, which bodes well for “a strong 2H for AMD in the client market.”\\n\\nWhile Richard thinks AMD’s revenue share in PC clients amounts to approximately 20% right now, over the next couple of years, he expects it to get closer to 50%.\\n\\nFurther bolstering the case for AMD is the anticipated closing of the Xilinx deal, which Richard believes will “significantly broaden AMD's IP portfolio and broaden its exposure to comms, industrial and automotive markets.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSo, all good news for AMD but what are the implications for investors? Richard reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares and keeps the $116 price target intact. Investors could be sitting on gains of 49%, should the analyst’s thesis play out in the year ahead. (To watch Richard’s track record, click here)\\n\\nNot all of Wall Street’s analyst corps are currently behind AMD but enough to merit a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 10 Buys, 7 Holds and 1 Sell issued over the past 3 months. The average price target clocks in at $105.40, implying shares will be changing hands for ~35% premium in one year’s time.

       "  'title': 'Advanced Micro (AMD) Down 6.8% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?',\n",
       "  'content': \"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Shares have lost about 6.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\\n\\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Advanced Micro due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\\n\\nAMD Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported first-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 52 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.18%. Notably, the bottom line soared 189% year over year but remained flat sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues of $3.445 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.46% and surged 93% year over year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the top line increased 6%.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrength in the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom divisions drove year-over-year improvement. AMD also stated that it completed several regulatory milestones for its proposed acquisition of Xilinx as shareholders approved of the deal. The buyout is expected to conclude by end of 2021.\\n\\nSegmental Details\\n\\nComputing and Graphics segment’s (61% of total revenues) revenues of $2.1 billion, increased 46% year over year and 7% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to robust adoption of Ryzen and Radeon processors, and higher revenues from client processor and graphics sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nClient processor average selling price (ASP) was record high as client computing revenues grew in double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis and improved sequentially. The increase was driven by a favorable mix of Ryzen desktop and notebook processor sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home and online learning wave continued to drive PC market strength, which led to robust growth in client processor revenues especially across ultrathin, gaming, and commercial segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering notebooks, AMD delivered sixth straight quarter of record mobile processor revenues driven by persistent demand for Ryzen 4000 Series processors and incremental adoption of newly launched Ryzen 5000 Series processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement noted that Ryzen Mobile 5000 Series processor raked in revenues twice as fast as the prior generation. Momentum is expected to continue through 2021 as the number of notebook platforms powered by new processors is on track to increase by 50% compared to the prior generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the commercial market, Ryzen PRO Processors’ unit shipments improved by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. The company clinched multiple high-volume wins across Fortune 500 companies across aerospace, automotive, electronics, and engineering domains in the first quarter. Management was elated as the company tripled commercial notebook design wins across the largest OEMs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn graphics, revenues surged in double-digit percentage both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, courtesy of channel sales growth driven by solid uptick in high-end Radeon 6000 GPUs, revenues from which more than doubled from the prior quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the company rolled out Radeon 6700 XT desktop GPU with leading 1440p gaming performance and remains on track for the first notebooks featuring the latest leading-edge mobile RDNA 2 architecture and 7 nanometer (nm) process technology to launch later in second quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, AMD anticipates Radeon 6000 Series GPU sales to grow significantly over the coming quarters as production ramps up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company noted that Data Center GPU business improved on a year-over-year basis as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis, backed by growing clout of Instinct accelerators across cloud and HPC customers. GPU ASP was higher both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, owing to strong uptake of high-end Radeon graphics products.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraction witnessed across AMD Instinct MI100 accelerator chips is noteworthy. The company also added that it is working on commencing the production ramp of AMD Instinct GPU to support the launch of Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer; as well as various other HPC deal wins.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment’s (39% of total revenues) revenues of $1.345 billion were up 286% year over year and 5% sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year-over-year increase can be attributed to higher semi-custom product sales and EPYC processor revenues. The sequential increase was led by higher EPYC processor sales, which was partially offset by lower semi-custom product sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemi-custom revenues declined by a single-digit percentage sequentially, which per management fared better than typical seasonality. The company anticipates semi-custom sales to remain strong through 2021, courtesy of robust demand for the latest gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn server domain, AMD witnessed sequential increase in both second and third generation EPYC processors. Growing adoption of second generation solutions was complemented by third generation EPYC processors, which are successfully ramping into production amid new deal wins from major enterprise, cloud, and HPC companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD noted record server processor revenues as EPYC processor sales more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and grew by a strong double-digit percentage on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkedly, third generation EPYC processors offer 25% more performance per watt compared to previous generation and offers leading per core and per socket performance, across database, ERP, data analytics, Java, virtualization, cloud, and supercomputing workloads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cloud vertical, AMD highlighted that demand was strong following the roll out of 11 new AMD-based public cloud instances in the reported quarter by major Tier 1 cloud providers, as they expanded their EPYC processor deployments to power more of their internal infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD’s focus on introducing new high-performance EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs to support complex applications, advanced modeling, database and hyper-converged workloads are driving growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn enterprise domain, the company’s servers are witnessing rapid uptake as companies like Cisco, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro, continue to expand their AMD-based offerings with more than 100 new third generation EPYC processor-powered server platforms that deliver enhanced performance and total cost of ownership (TCO).\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, management is optimistic on increasing utilization of AMD CPUs and GPUs across supercomputing systems. In HPC domain, the company clinched new high-volume wins, including Sweden's Institute of Science, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and an exclusive on-prem and cloud solution for the U.K.'s National Weather Modeling Service, which is touted to be the world's most powerful weather and climate forecasting supercomputer.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOperating Details\\n\\nNon-GAAP gross margin remained unchanged at 46% on a year-over-year basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses were 24%, contracting 900 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter’s levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjusted EBITDA soared 181.9% year over year to $857 million. The upside can be attributed to earnings growth. Non-GAAP operating margin of 22% expanded 900 bps year over year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSegment wise, Computing and Graphics operating income was $485 million (23% of segment revenue) up 85% year over year, courtesy of higher revenues. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $277 million (21% of segment revenue) against operating loss of $26 million reported in the year-ago quarter, owing to higher revenues.\\n\\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\\n\\nAs of Mar 27, 2021, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $3.116 billion compared with $2.29 billion as of Dec 26, 2020. As of Mar 27, 2021, total debt (long-term plus short-term) was $314 million, down from $338 million as of Dec 26, 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperating cash flow was reported at $898 million compared with $554 million in fourth-quarter 2020. Free cash flow was $832 million in the first quarter compared with $480 million in fourth-quarter 2020.\\n\\nHikes ‘21 Revenue Guidance\\n\\nAMD expects second-quarter 2021 revenues to be $3.6 billion (+/-$100 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 86% and quarter-over-quarter improvement of 4%. For second-quarter 2021, AMD expects robust sales across all its businesses to drive year-over-year increase in revenues. Meanwhile, the sequential increase is projected to be led by growth across data center and gaming verticals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 47%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $900 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2021, management now expects revenues to increase 50% year over year, compared with prior projected growth of 37%, encouraged by improvement across all its businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the company continues to expect non-GAAP gross margin for 2021 to be 47%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are anticipated to be 26% of total revenues.\\n\\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\\n\\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month. The consensus estimate has shifted 18.45% due to these changes.\\n\\nVGM Scores\\n\\nAt this time, Advanced Micro has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.\\n\\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Advanced Micro has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'Nvidia vs. AMD: Which Chip Stock Will Fetch Higher Returns?',\n",
       "  'content': \"Last year, the semiconductor industry saw strong demand for semiconductors as people working and studying remotely led to rising demand for laptops, PCs, and gaming consoles. According to an EET Asia report from earlier this month, citing data from International Data Corp. (IDC), semiconductor revenues rose 10.8% year-on-year on a global basis to $464 billion in 2020.\\n\\nAccording to IDC, the semiconductor market is expected to grow 12.5% year-over-year to $522 billion in 2021, fuelled by rising demand for semiconductors used in 5G, automotive, computing, and consumer applications.\\n\\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two chip companies, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA)\\n\\nNvidia’s products include graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center platforms and systems. The company reported its earnings on May 26 with adjusted earnings of $3.66 per share in Q1 FY22, a jump of 103% on a year-over-year basis, topping the Street’s estimates of $3.28 per share. Revenues popped 84% year-over-year to $5.66 billion in the first quarter beating analysts’ expectations of $5.41 billion.\\n\\nNVDA’s data center, gaming, and professional visualization platforms recorded a year-over-year jump of 79%, 106%, and 21%, respectively.\\n\\nNvidia anticipates revenues of around $6.3 billion in the second quarter of FY22. The company continues to expect its gaming and data center platforms to continue to register a quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter.\\n\\nThe company’s GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs have been incredibly popular and in strong demand. NVDA commented on the GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs at its earnings call, “Channel inventories are still leading and we expect to remain supply constrained into the second half of the year.”\\n\\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia introduced cryptocurrency mining processors (CMP) that earned revenues of $155 million in Q1. In the second quarter, the company anticipates revenues from CMPs to be $400 million.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNvidia foresees a significant opportunity to earn revenues from the Omniverse Enterprise platform, a technology platform that enables 3D design teams to work together in real-time on a global basis. The company stated at its earnings call that over 400 companies are in the process of evaluating Omniverse and around 17,000 users have downloaded the open beta platform.\\n\\nThe company has also benefited greatly from its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. NVDA completed the acquisition in April last year and paid $7 billion for the company.\\n\\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said about the acquisition, “Mellanox, one year in, has exceeded our expectations and transformed NVIDIA into a data-center-scale computing company.”\\n\\nIn April this year, the company unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled processor, NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan, for autonomous vehicles and is targeting automaker’s autonomous vehicle models in 2025.\\n\\nThe company has also announced its first data center CPU, NVIDIA Grace, its first Arm-based processor CPU that is expected to be available in early 2023. Nvidia said at its earnings call that the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center had already announced plans to build supercomputers powered by the Grace data center CPU.\\n\\nNvidia’s proposed $40 billion acquisition of Cambridge-based Arm has come under scrutiny by the UK Government. In April this year, the UK Secretary of State had issued an intervention notice on behalf of the UK Government citing national security interests.\\n\\nHowever, Nvidia’s EVP and CFO, Colette Kress said on the Q1 earnings call, “On our Arm acquisition, we are making steady progress in working with the regulators across key regions. We remain on track to close the transaction within our original timeframe of early 2022…NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to enhance Arm's capabilities, and we are committed to invest in developing the Arm's ecosystem, enhancing R&D, adding IP and turbocharging its development to grow into new markets in the data center, IoT and embedded devices; areas where it only has a light footprint, or in some cases, none at all.”\\n\\nOn May 24, Nvidia’s board declared a 4:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to make its shares more accessible to a larger number of employees and investors. The proposed split will increase the company’s outstanding common shares to 4 billion. However, the split is conditional on shareholders’ approval at NVDA’s annual meeting to be held on June 3. (See Nvidia stock analysis on TipRanks)\\n\\nFollowing the earnings, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy and a price target of $800 on the stock. Mosesmann commented on the earnings in a note to investors, “Excellent earnings and guide last night as Nvidia hit record sales in its strategic market segments with growth to continue through the fiscal year. Management is navigating the supply chain constraints endemic in the industry and sees supply improving gradually as the year progresses.”\\n\\n“In terms of the Crypto factor that has unnerved investors on the risk of a big inventory correction, we applaud management’s move to Crypto Mining Processors (CMPs) that are unusable for gaming, and effective castration of new RTX 30 series for Ethereum mining (hash rates cut in half), which point to a much more benign Crypto cycle this go-around…The ARM play, which looks like a toss-up to us, will work regardless. NVDA remains for us as the best must-own secular AI semiconductor/IP play,” Mosesmann added.\\n\\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 25 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $728 implies 17.5% upside potential to current levels.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a semiconductor company whose products include graphics processing units (GPUs), semi-custom System-on-Chip (SOC) products and chipsets, x86 microprocessors (CPUs), and accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and graphics (APUs).\\n\\nLast month, AMD reported its first-quarter results with revenues of $3.4 billion, a jump of 93% year-on-year. This revenue growth was driven by a whopping 286% jump in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenues from higher sales of semi-custom SOC chipsets and EPYC server processors. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share, up 189% year-on-year.\\n\\nThe company’s Ryzen Mobile 500 Series processors for laptops that were introduced in January are doing exceedingly well and AMD expects sales of these processors to continue to grow this year. The number of laptops powered by these processors is expected to increase by 50% compared to AMD’s earlier generation of processors.\\n\\nAMD expects a significant rise in sales of its Radeon 6000 Series GPU in the coming quarters as the company ramps up production of these GPUs.\\n\\nWhen it comes to data center GPUs, revenues are expected to rise in the second half of this year as the company increases the production of the AMD Instinct GPU to “support multiple HPC wins including Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer.”\\n\\nAs demand for Microsoft's (MSFT) and Sony Group’s (SNY) gaming consoles go up, AMD expects sales of its semi-custom products to remain high throughout the year.\\n\\nIn the second quarter of FY21, AMD has forecast revenues of approximately $3.6 billion. It expects data center and gaming products to drive this 86% year-over-year growth in revenues. AMD anticipates non-GAAP gross margin to be around 47% in Q2.\\n\\nFor FY21, the company expects revenues to grow 50% year-over-year driven by growth across all its businesses.\\n\\nAMD’s President and CEO, Lisa Su stated at the earnings call, “We expect the number of AMD-powered instances to double by the end of the year to 400 as Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Tencent significantly expand their offerings with third-gen EPYC processors. For the enterprise, Cisco, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro all announced plans to expand their AMD-based offerings with more than 100 new third-gen EPYC processor-powered server platforms that deliver superior performance and total cost of ownership.”\\n\\nSu added, “2021 marks an inflection point in terms of the scale, ecosystem support, and customer adoption of our EPYC and instant processors.”\\n\\nThe company is also on track to close its acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) by the end of this year. In October last year, AMD announced the acquisition of Xilinx valued at $35 billion. Xilinx is a developer of highly flexible adaptive processing platforms.\\n\\nOn May 19, the company announced that it will buy back stock worth $4 billion. AMD intends to fund the share repurchase through cash generated from operations. (See Advanced Micro Devices stock analysis on TipRanks)\\n\\nOn May 24, Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy and a price target of $116 on the stock. Richard said in a research note to investors that the company is likely to be 30% Intel’s (INTC) size by next year and will likely exceed Intel’s gross margins in 2023.\\n\\nRichard stated, “AMD’s market share gains are likely to continue in 2H:21 and CY22 driven by corporate client and server. The acquisition of XLNX will significantly broaden AMD's IP portfolio and broaden its exposure to comms, industrial and automotive markets. We believe leadership in the x86 market is driven primarily by process technology and to a lesser extent design differentiation.”\\n\\nConsensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 10 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $105.40 implies 34.4% upside potential to current levels.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAMD is giving Nvidia a run for its money when it comes to demand for its GPUs and data center processing platforms. However, Nvidia seems to be targeting new industries like the cryptocurrency mining and automotive industry with its CMP processors and its AI-enabled NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan processors.\\n\\nWhile analysts are bullish about NVDA, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, AMD seems to be a better buy.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has had an excellent 2021 and investors are enjoying the growth of the company. AMD stock saw the biggest highs over the past year and was very close to hitting triple digits. The stock hit an all-time high of more than $99 in 2020. However, thanks to volatility the stock is far from its peak. This is a great opportunity to buy AMD stock. What to Expect From AMD Stock Ahead of July's Earnings Report\\n\\nSource: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThe stock is trading at around $80 today. It could certainly be the best growth stock for the year. I believe the company will get a push in 2021 with the strong first quarter results and the recently announced share buyback plan. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the investment case for AMD stock.\\n\\nAMD Stock: Stellar Q1 results\\n\\nAMD recently reported Q1 results passing analysts expectations and raising hope about the future of the company. The revenue stood at $3.45 billion which is a 93% rise year over year and a 6% rise over the last quarter.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe gross margin was 46% which is constant year over year while the operating income was $662 million as compared to an operating income of $177 million a year ago, showing a 223% rise year over year. Higher revenue led to a rise in the operating income for the quarter. Further, the net income of the company stood at $555 million as compared to $162 million a year back, up 243% year over year.\\n\\nThe cash balance at the end of the quarter was $3.12 billion. AMD certainly had a blow-out quarter and the numbers are proof. It beat analyst estimates and has hit new highs in revenue and operating income. AMD went from $2 billion in 2014 to $90 billion in market value in 2021.\\n\\nThe 7 Best Stocks to Ride the Roaring Commodities Rally\\n\\nFor the second quarter, the company expects revenue to hit $3.6 billion, which is an 86% increase year over year. For the full year, the company expects revenue growth of 50% over 2020. It expects the growth to be driven by all businesses.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFurther, AMD is supposed to complete the $35 billion merger with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) later in the year. This merger could be game-changing for the company. In the recent quarterly reports, Xilinx beat expectations and reported a profit of 82 cents per share. There is a 13% rise in revenue amounting to $851 million, which is a record for the company. It also reported a net income of $188 million for the fourth quarter and full-year earnings of $2.62 per share.\\n\\nThe numbers are right before the planned merger and it shows the tremendous potential of the company once the merger is complete. The decision about the same will be taken by July 6.\\n\\n$4 billion buyback plan\\n\\nAMD made strong headlines after announcing the first buyback plan worth $4 million since 2001. The repurchase will not be funded by debt, but rather by the cash generation of the company.\\n\\nAMD is enjoying one of its best years and riding a massive success wave. It is growing across all fronts with the success in Ryzen gaming. The revenue has been consistently growing since 2017 and is accelerating with each passing year. With revenue, the company’s cash flow margin is consistently growing displaying the strength of its products.\\n\\nIf the company continues to grow at the same pace, it will be worth much more in the next two years and AMD stock will hit a new peak. Currently, the company has a cash balance of $3.12 billion and it will easily have a free cash flow of $4 billion and can complete the buyback program through cash generation.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line on AMD stock\\n\\nThe strong fundamentals and a stronghold in the market make AMD the perfect growth stock. Considering the growth in sales and revenue across all products, the company could report new highs this year and AMD stock could hit $100.\\n\\nIf AMD can continue to grow market share like it has been doing in the past, it will certainly reward investors.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a growth stock to add to your portfolio, buy AMD stock and hold it forever.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $81.97 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.44% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.15% gain on the day.\\n\\nComing into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 2.8% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 0.49%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.58%.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.54, up 200% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.61 billion, up 86.86% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.16 per share and revenue of $14.69 billion, which would represent changes of +67.44% and +50.46%, respectively, from the prior year.\\n\\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\\n\\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.84% higher within the past month. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\\n\\nInvestors should also note AMD's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 37.38. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.65, which means AMD is trading at a premium to the group.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMeanwhile, AMD's PEG ratio is currently 1.07. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.54 at yesterday's closing price.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 71, which puts it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\\n\\nTo follow AMD in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Recent Stock Performance Looks Decent- Can Strong Fundamentals Be the Reason?\",\n",
       "  'content': 'Advanced Micro Devices\\' (NASDAQ:AMD) stock up by 4.5% over the past week. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company\\'s key financial indicators as a company\\'s long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Advanced Micro Devices\\'  ROE in this article.\\n\\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder\\'s equity.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\\n\\nThe formula for ROE is:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\\' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is:\\n\\n45% = US$2.9b ÷ US$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).\\n\\nThe \\'return\\' refers to a company\\'s earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder\\'s investments, the company generates a profit of $0.45.\\n\\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\\n\\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\\'t have the same features.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices\\' Earnings Growth And 45% ROE\\n\\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Advanced Micro Devices has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company\\'s ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Advanced Micro Devices\\' considerable five year net income growth of 81% was to be expected.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Advanced Micro Devices\\' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 16% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\\n\\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Advanced Micro Devices fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\\n\\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Advanced Micro Devices\\' performance. In particular, it\\'s great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

       "  'title': \"Advanced Micro (AMD) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know\",\n",
       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\\n\\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\\n\\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\\n\\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Advanced Micro is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\\n\\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\\n\\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\\n\\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Advanced Micro imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\\n\\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Advanced Micro\\n\\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2021, this chipmaker is expected to earn $2.16 per share, which is a change of 67.4% from the year-ago reported number.\\n\\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Advanced Micro. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 12.3%.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\\n\\nThe upgrade of Advanced Micro to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On that day, AMD is projected to report earnings of $0.54 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 200%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.61 billion, up 86.86% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.16 per share and revenue of $14.69 billion, which would represent changes of +67.44% and +50.46%, respectively, from the prior year.\\n\\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\\n\\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\\n\\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that AMD has a Forward P/E ratio of 37.63 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.69, which means AMD is trading at a premium to the group.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlso, we should mention that AMD has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Electronics - Semiconductors stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.63 based on yesterday's closing prices.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 88, putting it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'title': 'AMD: Corporate Notebook Gains Set to Continue',\n",
       "  'content': \"Over the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has become a force to be reckoned with in the semiconductor industry. Its market share has continually expanded as superior products have eaten away at traditionally bigger rival Intel’s dominance.\\n\\nAt the same time, the share price exploded. That is until this year, as the pullback in growth stocks has not spared AMD.\\n\\nHowever, while the stock is in the red for the year, the company continues to impress in the real world. With this in mind, Northland’s Gus Richard thinks investors can snap up shares on the cheap.\\n\\nRichard reiterated an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMD stock along with a $116 price target. Investors could be pocketing gains of ~42%, should Richard’s forecast hit the mark over the next 12 months. (To watch Richard’s track record, click here)\\n\\nRichard’s analysis indicates AMD’s “market share momentum” is showing no signs of slowing down. And the analyst anticipates the company will keep on charging ahead.\\n\\n“We expect an increasing mix of corporate notebook revenue to drive client revenue growth in 2H,” the 5-star analyst said. “AMD's server market share accelerated in Q1 and AMD launched its 7nm server chip in Q1 that will likely accelerate share gains in 2H. We believe AMD is getting ample capacity from TSMC, and high-end AMD systems will be the least likely to suffer from component shortages.”\\n\\nIt is in the corporate notebook segment, the “high-end of the market,” in particular, where AMD is gaining market share. This has traditionally been Intel’s turf, but during CY19, Intel’s 14nm capacity hit a brick wall, which “opened the door” for AMD in this highly lucrative market.\\n\\nRichard estimates that AMD’s share of the corporate notebook segment is currently “in the low single digits” but expects it will boast “significant expansion this year. “\\n\\nAnecdotally, Richard’s industry checks suggest analysts at small investment banks are still running Windows 7, implying corporate notebooks “are still on backorders.” Therefore, despite expecting a slowdown in the consumer notebook market, the analyst believes the corporate market gives AMD “good visibility into 2H:21.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLooking at the rest of Street’s analysts, most of Richard’s colleagues believe the shares are undervalued. Going by the $105.06 average price target, the projection is for one-year upside of 29%. Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 11 Buys, 7 Holds and 2 Sells.

       "  'title': 'Hedge Funds Are Cashing Out Of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)',\n",
       "  'content': \"Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a good place to invest some of your money right now? We can gain invaluable insight to help us answer that question by studying the investment trends of top investors, who employ world-class Ivy League graduates, who are given immense resources and industry contacts to put their financial expertise to work. The top picks of these firms have historically outperformed the market when we account for known risk factors, making them very valuable investment ideas.\\n\\nIs Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a buy, sell, or hold? Money managers were taking a bearish view. The number of bullish hedge fund bets decreased by 12 in recent months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was in 62 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 74. Our calculations also showed that AMD isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). There were 74 hedge funds in our database with AMD positions at the end of the fourth quarter.\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings. FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT\\n\\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best hydrogen fuel cell stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind we're going to take a gander at the recent hedge fund action surrounding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think AMD Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nHeading into the second quarter of 2021, a total of 62 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -16% from the previous quarter. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in AMD over the last 23 quarters. With hedgies' sentiment swirling, there exists a few key hedge fund managers who were increasing their stakes meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).\\n\\nThe largest stake in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was held by Citadel Investment Group, which reported holding $1432 million worth of stock at the end of December. It was followed by Fisher Asset Management with a $747.8 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Arrowstreet Capital, Citadel Investment Group, and Sylebra Capital Management. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Sylebra Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), around 8.64% of its 13F portfolio. Andar Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 7.45 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AMD.\\n\\nSeeing as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a decline in interest from hedge fund managers, it's safe to say that there is a sect of hedge funds who were dropping their positions entirely by the end of the first quarter. Interestingly, Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners sold off the largest investment of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, worth close to $553.7 million in stock. Andreas Halvorsen's fund, Viking Global, also dropped its stock, about $368.2 million worth. These transactions are important to note, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 12 funds by the end of the first quarter.\\n\\nLet's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), Vale SA (NYSE:VALE), British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI), and Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM). This group of stocks' market caps are closest to AMD's market cap.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position MO,38,1109493,1 ZM,54,5672277,-5 SYK,46,3154010,2 GSK,25,1359731,-5 VALE,31,2615665,-4 BTI,14,1034777,4 ANTM,58,5373054,-12 Average,38,2902715,-2.7 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 38 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $2903 million. That figure was $3703 million in AMD's case. Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AMD is 68.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and still beat the market by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately AMD wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on AMD were disappointed as the stock returned 3.6% since the end of the first quarter (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

       "  'content': 'After Wednesday’s Fed meeting and before tomorrow’s quadruple witching expiration, we’ve had a lot of big moves taking place on Thursday. That said, let’s look at some of the charts for our top stock trades.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been trading sideways for a while now. However, it finally gave bulls something to cheer about on Thursday.\\n\\nShares jumped about 6% on the day and grinded near its highs all session. The stock has been consolidating all month, as it holds up over the 50-day and 10-day moving averages.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nWith Thursday’s burst, AMD stock is now back above the 200-day moving average as well. If it can continue higher, I want to see how the stock handles the $88 to $89 area, as well as downtrend resistance (blue line). A move above that area puts $90-plus in play.\\n\\n7 A-Rated Biotech Stocks to Buy Now\\n\\nOn the downside, I don’t want to see this name lose the 200-day moving average or $82.50. Below both and its recent consolidation range could be back in play, or lower.\\n\\nAs of now, we have a monthly-up rotation in AMD.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Nvidia (NVDA) Top stock trades for NVDA\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nSticking with the same group, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hit new 52-week highs in the session. Shares have been on fire — there’s no other way to put it.\\n\\nThe stock slipped a bit from $750, but if Nvidia can take out this week’s high, the $765 area may be in play. Above that, and $800 can’t be ruled out.\\n\\nThat would take the stock to $200 post-split (scheduled for July).\\n\\nFor longer-term bulls, they may target the $825 to $860 area on the upside. That marks the 161.8% extensions from various ranges over the past few quarters.\\n\\nOn the downside, I want to see an eventual test of the 10-day moving average hold as support, hopefully giving bulls a dip to buy.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Silver ETF (SLV) Top stock trades for SLV\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nSilver and gold have been getting smacked around lately, as the former gapped down on Thursday. That’s shown via the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV).\\n\\nSo where to from here?\\n\\nFor the SLV, it gapped down right into the 200-day moving average, which is holding as support for now.

       "  'content': \"On Thursday, Advanced Micro Devices and Alphabet's Google Cloud said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip.\\n\\nVideo Transcript\\n\\nMYLES UDLAND: Let's talk about a stock that is on the move higher in that tech sector. That is AMD. Stock is up about 3%. And Julie, we get some headlines here on AMD striking a deal with Google on its chips, getting involved with the cloud products suite of services.\\n\\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's a data center chip in particular. So AMD basically said, and Google said, Google is going to offer cloud computing services based on that newest data center chip from AMD. And of course, this is a reflection of the fight that we've been seeing ongoing between AMD and Intel for market share. AMD's really been gaining some traction on Intel over the past couple of years, so this is yet another feather in the cap, so to speak, for AMD and is sending those shares higher. They're up about 4% today. They're not back at record levels, but nonetheless, we have definitely seen a comeback.\\n\\nAnd it is interesting, Myles, obviously this is news-driven, but generally as we see the strength in tech today, it sort of flies in the face, doesn't it, of the idea that or the narrative we saw earlier in the year that higher rates were somehow going to be more negative for the tech sector? In the wake of the Fed yesterday, it seems as though we're going to see higher rates sooner rather than later, although still way in the future. But tech is actually performing fairly well.\\n\\nMYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I think we saw, Sozzi, you remember that we saw all the peak growth stories. There was certainly an element of that in the tech trade. The NASDAQ has not been super encouraging over the balance of this year, but it does seem with the end of whatever emergency, however we want to characterize the Fed's emergency pandemic settings, but the end of that now starting to come into focus.\\n\\nWe begin to see I think the market really moving back towards what worked in the last cycle. And what worked in the last cycle is what a lot of people believe is going to work over the longer term looking past through the recovery into whatever the economy looks like as we normalize out of the pandemic. And so that is likely to be more growthier names, more of your secular growers, and of course, when we look at that part of the market, that really is where we find a lot of those tech names.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'It might seem astounding, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a very attractive price point. Yes, AMD stock, the one that has outperformed the S&P 500 by 1,560% and its sector by 1,400% in the last five years. amd stock\\n\\nSource: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nTechnology as a sector still looks like a buy after a recent rebound. However, AMD has strangely bucked the trend. Shares of the American multinational semiconductor company are down 6% year-to-date. In comparison, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 46% during the same period.\\n\\nAMD has rolled out highly competitive lines of chips in the last few years, leading to a bonanza in terms of EPS and sales.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe company also generates a healthy amount of revenue from cloud computing and the related data center buildout. When you combine that with dividend growth of 6.8% in the last five years, you have all the makings of a world-beater. Why we do not see more people pouring capital into this stock at this time is amazing.\\n\\nBut then again, it means you can pick this up at a relative discount. But the window might be closing soon.\\n\\nAMD Stock Is a Leader in Its Sector\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a leading producer of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) used in data center servers, PCs, and videogame consoles. So, when you purchase this stock, you are getting exposure to several high-growth areas.\\n\\n10 Best Stocks to Buy to Build Up Passive Income Streams\\n\\nHistorically, the company lagged in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But it is now dominating its rival because of innovative chip designs and manufacturing issues at Intel.\\n\\nMuch of the credit goes to the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, who took the helm in 2014. At that time, many investors believed AMD could file for bankruptcy soon.\\n\\nHowever, under the leadership of Su, the company made a series of outstanding technical decisions leading to eventual victory against Intel. Along the way, the market cap grew to more than $102 billion from about $2 billion in 2014.\\n\\nStory continues Chart showing AMD stock performance against its main rivals\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of StockRover.com\\n\\nIn the last five years, the top line and bottom line have increased by 30.1% and 48.5%, respectively. On the back of this excellent operating performance, AMD’s cash position has increased sharply to $2.3 billion last year, from $1.5 billion in 2019.\\n\\nAMD currently does not pay a dividend. But having so much cash at its disposal means the tech giant can create shareholder wealth through buybacks and accretive acquisitions or mergers.\\n\\nStock Buyback Plan\\n\\nIn May, Advanced Micro Devices announced a $4 billion stock buyback plan, its first repurchase authorization since 2001.\\n\\nAccording to a statement from the company, the stock buyback program will be funded by cash from operations and has no termination date.\\n\\n“Our strong financial results and growing cash generation enable us to invest in the business and begin returning capital to our shareholders,” Su said.\\n\\nAMD stock rose as much as 3.4% on the announcement. It is not surprising. Whenever companies return wealth to shareholders, stock price appreciations will naturally follow. And with such a large war chest, one can expect such moves to continue in the future.\\n\\nWhat Does the Future Hold For AMD?\\n\\nAMD is a fast-growing semiconductor company operating in the attractive personal computer and data center markets space. In the next few years, the company should continue growing profits at an excellent pace. The best thing is its involvement in high-growth sectors.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, and data centers, all these areas will continue to grow exponentially moving forward.\\n\\nIn addition, its GPU chips power Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new Xbox and Sony (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation console upgrade cycle. And that’s not all. The potential release of a new Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch later this year equals further cash for AMD.\\n\\nSeparately, the company and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud recently announced Google would offer cloud computing services based on AMD’s “Milan” server chip, released in March, further denting rival Intel’s market share.\\n\\nThe move caught the attention of investors in general, but Redditors also noticed. Mentions of the company exploded after the news broke. I recommend you check out Brenden Rearick’s excellent piece for more on this and the Google announcement.\\n\\nGrab the Discount Offer\\n\\nOverall, there is much to like about AMD stock. However, astoundingly despite all of its amazing progress, the stock continues to trade at a relative discount this year, making it one of the rare attractively priced tech stocks with excellent fundamentals.\\n\\nBut, considering Redditors are interested in this one, I expect shares to skyrocket soon enough. And even if that does not happen, this is a solid enough stock on its own merits.\\n\\nSo, buy this one before it shoots to the moon.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. fell, erasing an earlier gain, after saying a new version of its Xeon server chip line will go into production in 2022, rather than by the end of this year as promised.Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rose after Intel said Tuesday that a chip design, code-named Sapphire Rapids, will begin production in the first quarter of 2022 with the “ramp” beginning the following quarter. The world’s largest chipmaker previously said the new version of its most lucrative product line would start to be manufactured this year.Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has pledged to return Intel to a dominant position in computer processors and reassert the company’s once unassailable lead in semiconductor manufacturing after multiyear delays in the introduction of new technology forced it to cede leadership to rivals. Gelsinger, who promised the new chip would arrive this year as recently as April, last week replaced the head of Intel’s server chip unit in an executive shake-up.“Given the breadth of enhancements in Sapphire Rapids, we are incorporating additional validation time prior to the production release, which will streamline the deployment process for our customers and partners,” Intel Vice President Lisa Spelman said in a post on the company’s website. “Based on this, we now expect Sapphire Rapids to be in production in the first quarter of 2022, with ramp beginning in the second quarter of 2022.”\\n\\nIntel shares declined 1.6% to $56.58 at 1:25 p.m. in New York while AMD gained 3% to $89.69.Given the delays to the 10-nanometer manufacturing process and holdups in bringing its replacement online, the latest announcement will cause concern about further decays in Intel’s competitive positioning, according to Sanford C.

       "  'title': 'I Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Passed With Ease',\n",
       "  'content': \"Some have more dollars than sense, they say, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can easily find investors. And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices's Improving Profits\\n\\nIn a capitalist society capital chases profits, and that means share prices tend rise with earnings per share (EPS). So like the hint of a smile on a face that I love, growing EPS generally makes me look twice. You can imagine, then, that it almost knocked my socks off when I realized that Advanced Micro Devices grew its EPS from US$0.43 to US$2.41, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\\n\\nI like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Advanced Micro Devices is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.7 percentage points to 16%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.\\n\\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\\n\\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Advanced Micro Devices's future profits.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAre Advanced Micro Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\\n\\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$109b company like Advanced Micro Devices. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth US$552m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.\\n\\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Worth Keeping An Eye On?\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That EPS growth certainly has my attention, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke my interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So to my mind Advanced Micro Devices is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Advanced Micro Devices has  2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.\\n\\nOf course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But as a growth investor I always like to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.\\n\\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

       "  'title': 'I Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Passed With Ease',\n",
       "  'content': \"Some have more dollars than sense, they say, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can easily find investors. And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices's Improving Profits\\n\\nIn a capitalist society capital chases profits, and that means share prices tend rise with earnings per share (EPS). So like the hint of a smile on a face that I love, growing EPS generally makes me look twice. You can imagine, then, that it almost knocked my socks off when I realized that Advanced Micro Devices grew its EPS from US$0.43 to US$2.41, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\\n\\nI like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Advanced Micro Devices is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.7 percentage points to 16%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.\\n\\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\\n\\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Advanced Micro Devices's future profits.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAre Advanced Micro Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\\n\\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$109b company like Advanced Micro Devices. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth US$552m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.\\n\\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Worth Keeping An Eye On?\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That EPS growth certainly has my attention, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke my interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So to my mind Advanced Micro Devices is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Advanced Micro Devices has  2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.\\n\\nOf course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But as a growth investor I always like to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.\\n\\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

I\\'ve been recommending it under $80 since March because it trades at half the price/sales valuation of peer NVDA. Start a position under $95 and look for pullbacks to $90 to add. I believe we\\'ll see new highs above $100 very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I didn\\'t know when I taped the video Wednesday morning is that the same BofA analyst mentioned above raised his price target today on AMD from $110 to $120 for the same valuation and datacenter inroads I\\'ve been talking about all month!\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure: I own NVDA, AMD, and QCOM for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio service.\\n\\nBitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything\\r\\n\\r\\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $94.70 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.49% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.75%.\\n\\nHeading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 16.08% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.17% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.52% in that time.\\n\\nAMD will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.54 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 200%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.61 billion, up 86.86% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.16 per share and revenue of $14.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +67.44% and +50.46%, respectively, from last year.\\n\\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\\n\\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. AMD is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\\n\\nDigging into valuation, AMD currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 43.81. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.43.\\n\\nAlso, we should mention that AMD has a PEG ratio of 1.25. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Electronics - Semiconductors industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.53 as of yesterday's close.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 108, putting it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'title': \"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) High 39.2 P/E Might be Backed by Growth and High Demand\",\n",
       "  'content': 'This article was originally published on Simply Wall St News\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\\'s ( NASDAQ:AMD ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 39.2x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 19x and even P/E\\'s below 11x are quite common.\\n\\nAs we remember, P/E shows investors the number of years it takes for the company to earn the same amount currently paid for an individual share. It is common for investors to be willing to pay a large P/E if a company has high growth potential, but when growth settles down, they may start weighing the difference between the price of shares and their earning capacity.\\n\\nWe need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\\n\\nWe will start by looking at why AMD has a high P/E, and explore possible implications.\\n\\nAs you might know, AMD saw a 93% growth in aggregate from both of its segments in Q1 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\\n\\nThe main drivers are the mass uptake of its Ryzen™ processors and Radeon™ products, as well as the increase of EPYC™ server processors.\\n\\nThis led to a high growth in both of their segments. The computing & graphics segment grew from US$1.4b to US$2.1b, a 46% growth compared to the prior year period and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue was US$1.345b marking a 286% increase in the same manner.\\n\\nPrice to Earnings\\n\\nIn the graph below, we can see the current P/E of AMD in comparison to the semiconductor industry and US Market.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  pe\\n\\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our  free  report on Advanced Micro Devices  will help you uncover what\\'s on the horizon.\\n\\nIs There Enough Growth For Advanced Micro Devices?\\n\\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Advanced Micro Devices would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 458% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 2,758% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 6% per year during the coming three years, according to the analysts following the company.\\n\\nBased on the quality of AMD\\'s current technology, this might be the long term expected growth. However, as long as AMD can keep up innovating and set a comparable quality standard to Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), they will have an opportunity to expand even more, and possibly cut into their competitor\\'s market share.\\n\\nLooking at analyst expectations both for earnings and revenue, we can see that there is a lot of optimism for the future, with an expected revenue growth of 12.7% and expected earnings growth of 16.9%.\\n\\nNASDAQ:AMD Analyst Forecasts for Revenue & Earnings vs the Market and Industry\\n\\nCompetitor Comparison\\n\\nAMD\\'s main competitors are Intel and NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and are considered leaders in their respective segments, as outlined in AMD\\'s competition analysis . Intel is a competitor in microprocessors, while NVIDIA competes in graphical processing units (GPUs). Interestingly, Intel has also announced it is developing and testing their own high-end discrete GPUs.\\n\\nIn the table below, we will compare the Price to Earnings ratio and revenue growth rates of AMD and 2 of their competitors. Keep in mind that these companies are chosen based on their connection to the demand of comparable products such as GPUs and Microprocessors.\\n\\nTable: P/E and Estimated Future Revenue growth Comparison Between Competitors, the Semiconductor Industry and the US Market\\n\\nAMD Intel NVDIA Industry Market P/E 39.2 12.7 95.2 34.9 19.3 Future Revenue Growth 12.7% -0.2% 11.6% 8.3% 9.4%\\n\\nFrom the table above, we can see that AMD does not differ too much from the current industry P/E, and their projected growth rate may give investors some piece of mind when considering the valuation. Intel looks more fairly priced, but seems to be currently approaching a mature growth phase. It is also interesting to see that the market gives NVIDIA even more credit for their potential future growth and innovation.\\n\\nWhat We Can Learn From Advanced Micro Devices\\' P/E?\\n\\nWe\\'d say the price-to-earnings ratio\\'s power isn\\'t primarily as a valuation instrument, but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\\n\\nWhen tying the P/E ratio to growth, the picture we get is no longer that of sole overconfidence. We see that investors may value future innovation and growth more than their current earning capacity.\\n\\nConsidering the competitor analysis, we can notice that it is not uncommon to see semiconductor stocks trading at high P/E valuations, but we should be also mindful that this industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns in demand in the past.\\n\\nAMD is part of an industry that is currently in high demand and whose products drive decentralized growth across multiple sectors in the market. It seems that investors are factoring-in the known but also the possible unknown future applications of their technology.\\n\\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we\\'ve spotted  2 warning signs for Advanced Micro Devices  (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.\\n\\nIf you\\'re unsure about the strength of Advanced Micro Devices\\' business , why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.\\n\\nSimply Wall St analyst Goran Damchevski and Simply Wall St have no position in any of the companies mentioned.

       "  'title': '3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Advanced Micro (AMD)',\n",
       "  'content': \"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\\n\\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\\n\\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\\n\\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\\n\\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this chipmaker a great growth pick right now.\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 95.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 67.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 42.2%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 12.5%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 8%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Advanced Micro. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Advanced Micro a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination indicates that Advanced Micro is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has topped estimates by 14.41%, on average, in the last two quarters.\\n\\nFor the most recent quarter, Advanced Micro was expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share, but it reported $0.52 per share instead, representing a surprise of 18.18%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.47 per share, while it actually produced $0.52 per share, a surprise of 10.64%.\\n\\nPrice and EPS Surprise\\n\\nFor Advanced Micro, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\\n\\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro has an Earnings ESP of +3.41% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\\n\\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\\n\\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

       "  'content': 'When it comes to technical analysis, I’m an amateur. However, I can’t help but notice the battle rival chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have waged over the past five years. AMD stock and NVDA stock have swapped positions frequently, and I’m pretty sure they’ll continue to do so. An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.\\n\\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nOver the past five years, AMD has seen a cumulative return of nearly 1,700%. Over the same period, NVDA stock is up nearly 1,500%.\\n\\nHowever, over the past year, Nvidia has evened the score. It’s up 92%, whereas AMD is up almost 70%. The gap grew even larger over the past two months.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nNVDA stock gained 7.4% in May and 23% in June for a cumulative gain of 32%. Conversely, AMD lost 2.3% in May and gained 16% in June for a cumulative gain of 14.6%.\\n\\n7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy for July 2021\\n\\nNvidia’s performance in May and June was 2.2 times AMD’s. Can it leave its competitor in the dust?\\n\\nNVDA Stock Is About to Hit $1,000\\n\\nIn August 2020, I wrote that Nvidia’s next stop could be $1,000. At the time, it was trading around $434 per share. I thought the company was doing enough things to move its stock price higher. In hindsight, I wasn’t far off — the stock virtually doubled in price in less than a year.\\n\\n“I’ve always felt what sets Nvidia apart is its cash generation. In the three months ended April 26, it had free cash flow (FCF) of $754 million, 27% higher than a year earlier. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), it generated $4.43 billion in FCF, $160 million more than at the end of January,” I wrote at the time.\\n\\n“Importantly, its TTM FCF is more than 7x that of Advanced Micro Devices.”\\n\\nNvidia’s most recent quarterly report showed a business in fine form. Revenue rose 84% over last year to $5.66 billion. Operating income saw a 100% year-over-year (YoY) gain to $1.96 billion with no apparent weaknesses.\\n\\nIts Q1 free cash flow (FCF) was $1.56 billion, 106.5% higher than last year’s total. But FCF actually took a step backward on a sequential basis, dropping 11.9% from the previous quarter. However, last year’s Q1 FCF of $754 million was 42.9% lower than its previous quarter, so Nvidia managed to cut its sequential decline by 72% in the latest quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOver the trailing 12 months (TTM), Nvidia’s FCF was $5.52 billion, 17.7% higher than it was at the end of fiscal year 2021. Based on its current FCF and a market cap of $496.8 billion, it has an FCF yield of 1.1%.\\n\\nValuation-wise, Nvidia is priced to perfection. Its five-year average price-to-cash flow ratio is 43.3x. Its current ratio is at 74x. That’s 1.7 times its historical average.\\n\\nIn June, I suggested that NVDA stock was an excellent long-term buy regardless of whether its $40 billion acquisition of Arm went through. Well, several major chip players have since stepped up to endorse the deal, so barring unforeseen circumstances, it would appear the deal is on solid footing.\\n\\nI would not buy NVDA stock if your time frame for profits is less than a year. That said, momentum suggests it could hit $1,000 before the end of 2021, so aggressive investors can still try to ride Nvidia’s wave.\\n\\nAMD Could Put Up a Fight\\n\\nWhile I am definitely not a technical analyst, InvestorPlace contributor Tyler Craig is a chart watcher. On July 1, Craig suggested that AMD was ready to go on a run after being stuck in neutral for a long time.\\n\\nAccording to my colleague, AMD stock came to life in mid-June. When volumes rose, institutions started buying up shares.\\n\\n“June 17 was the day that flipped the switch for AMD. Prices broke above the 200-day moving average on huge volume, and we’ve seen nothing but extremely bullish movement since,” Craig wrote. “For the first time in a long time, all major moving averages are pointing higher giving the stock trend alignment across all time frames.”\\n\\nOver the past month, AMD shares gained 12.3%. But as Craig suggests, AMD has a history of going on decent runs before petering out. This could be the beginning of a major leg up to $100 or higher.\\n\\nThe stock has never traded above $100 in its 41-year history. It came close in January, hitting an all-time high of $99.23. Then AMD stock fell back into the low $70s in May.\\n\\nFrom its intraday low of $72.50 on May 13 to its recent high of $95.44 on July 7, AMD stock has gained 32%. However, if history is any indicator, the stock will likely breach $100 by the end of July.\\n\\nNVDA Stock Is Strong, But AMD May Still Catch Up\\n\\nIn August 2020, Nvidia’s TTM FCF was more than 7x AMD’s. Today, it’s only 3.2x AMD’s TTM FCF of $1.73 billion. That’s almost double its cash flow in its latest fiscal year and easily the best free cash flow generation in its history.\\n\\nAMD is trading at 53.3x cash flow in terms of valuation, significantly less than its five-year average and 28% lower than Nvidia.\\n\\nOverall, I still like NVDA stock more over the long haul. However, if considering both stocks, AMD is the better near-term buy.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.62% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.64% in that time.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.54, up 200% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.62 billion, up 87.38% from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nAMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.17 per share and revenue of $14.71 billion.

       "  'content': \"Over the past few years, Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) exceptional climb up the semiconductor food chain has resulted not only in increased market share for its products but has been mirrored by massive share price gains for the stock. Not so in 2021, a year which has disappointed investors so far.\\n\\nHowever, Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers thinks there are several reasons to believe AMD shares will be back on the front foot soon enough.\\n\\nWith server CPU momentum a “key focus,” the analyst thinks the company can “continue to gain PC and server CPU market share and see mix-driven GM% expansion.” Throw into the mix the prospective addition of Xilinx - the acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2021 – and the risk/reward paradigm for the stock looks “attractive.”\\n\\nLooking ahead to the upcoming Q2 results, Rakers expects “continued momentum” in the company’s 7nm Rome and Milan EPYC server CPUs. The analyst thinks the strong showing will boost investors’ confidence in the company’s ability to reach a 20%+ shipment share.\\n\\n“As a reminder,” the 5-star analyst noted, “AMD's Milan EPYC ramp entails a much broader systems OEM adoption: 100+ systems vs. nominal # of systems with Rome, as well as a continued broadening (+2x) cloud adoption with 400+ AMD-based cloud instances expected by the end of 2021.”\\n\\nAlthough Rakers thinks the focal point still revolves around “shipment share momentum,” the ramping of the 7nm Zen 3 Milan EPYC CPU product cycle remains “underappreciated.”\\n\\nThis is due to the benefit of a higher ASP (average selling price) for the Milan line-up compared to the Rome product line; Mercury Research estimatees a more than 50% ASP for Milan vs. Rome.\\n\\nConsidering the recent “increased uncertainty” for Intel’s next-gen Sapphire Rapids (10nm Enhanced SuperFin) and Granite Rapids (7nm) Xeon-SP processor roadmaps, Rakers thinks continued EPYC roadmap execution will remain an important factor in maintaining investors’ confidence.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOverall, Rakers remains confident in AMD’s ability to execute and reiterates an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares. The analyst also gives the stock a $120 price target that implies a potential upside of 38%. (To watch Rakers’ track record, click here)\\n\\nOverall, the Street’s average price target clocks in at $106.94, implying shares will add 23% of muscle in the coming months. Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 12 Buys and 8 Holds.

Shares of the chipmaker seem to be finally putting disappointed investors at ease after underperforming for almost the entire first half of 2021. It is now trading at 37 times trailing earnings, which is significantly higher than the multiple it was trading at in the middle of May.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $86.58 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.8% move from the prior day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.59%.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had gained 1.46% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.79% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.53% in that time.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 27, 2021. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.54, up 200% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.62 billion, up 87.38% from the prior-year quarter.\\n\\nAMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.17 per share and revenue of $14.71 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +68.22% and +50.7%, respectively.\\n\\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\\n\\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.24% higher. AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\\n\\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that AMD has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.67 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.72, which means AMD is trading at a premium to the group.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAlso, we should mention that AMD has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMD's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.48 as of yesterday's close.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 119, putting it in the top 47% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\\n\\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release\",\n",
       "  'content': \"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports results for the quarter ended June 2021. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +200%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $3.62 billion, up 87.4% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Advanced Micro?\\n\\nFor Advanced Micro, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.41%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\\n\\nSo, this combination indicates that Advanced Micro will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\\n\\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\\n\\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Advanced Micro would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +18.18%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\\n\\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': 'By Stephen Nellis and Subrat Patnaik\\n\\n(Reuters) - The global chip shortage has grounded major automotive factories to a halt but pushed technology giants to become more flexible by diverting existing supplies to their most profitable products, analysts and executives said.\\n\\nApple Inc said on Tuesday chip shortages had mostly affected its iPad and Mac products in its last quarter, but would start to bite into its mainstay iPhone business, its best seller and major profit driver, in the current quarter.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we\\'re dealt,\" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a post earnings conference call.\\n\\nThe comments provide an insight into how Apple, known for its deft supply chain management through long-term supply deals with Broadcom Inc and Qualcomm Inc, is dealing with the shortage ahead of the crucial holiday quarter when it sells millions of its new line of flagship phones.\\n\\nSome analysts believe Apple could be prioritizing chip supplies for its new phones during the July-September quarter, which is typically the sleepiest for iPhone sales as shoppers hold out for upcoming models.\\n\\n\"I think it largely reflects the timing of new product releases, specifically related to new iPhone launches in September,\" Angelo Zino, an analyst with research firm CFRA, said of Apple\\'s warning.\\n\\nEven in normal times, he said, \"new phone cycles typically start off supply constrained given the high demand needs ahead of the holiday selling season.\"\\n\\nAnd even within Apple\\'s current lineup, the company is likely to direct the supply chain pain to its least lucrative products, said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research.\\n\\nIts flagship phones also drive revenue from paid subscription services and accessories like AirPods.\\n\\n\"Assuming Apple prioritizes the iPhone 12 family, it probably affects iPads, Macs and older iPhones more,\" Fieldhack said.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe global chip shortage stems from a combination of factors including the fallout from last year\\'s COVID-19 shutdowns and factories struggling to meet demand for semiconductors, which have become omnipresent in an increasingly digitized world.\\n\\nThe supply squeeze took the auto industry by surprise. Car makers like Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co had to halt production lines for their popular pick-ups at a time when demand was booming as economies started to open up.\\n\\nThe auto industry relies almost exclusively on chips from a few manufacturers, so-called foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The shortage has exposed this reliance on overseas suppliers as an Achilles\\' heel for many companies.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC FOCUS\\n\\nTechnology companies, the traditional consumers of semiconductors, have been more nimble.\\n\\nChip designer Advanced Micro Devices, which makes central processor chips for PCs and data center servers, has also been redirecting supplies.\\n\\nThe company, which has a new family of chips that outperform offerings from larger rival Intel Corp, has steadily made gains in unit sales market share against the chip giant, which retains more than 80% of the overall market.\\n\\nAMD has responded to limited industry capacity by focusing on selling only its most profitable chips, leaving the lower end of the market to Intel, said Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, which tracks market share among chipmakers.\\n\\nIntel has also been struggling with its own set of challenges with manufacturing in recent years, causing it to fall behind AMD and Nvidia Corp.\\n\\n\"We\\'re focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors on a conference call.\\n\\n\"We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru and Danielle Kaye in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Analysis: Apple, AMD navigate chip shortage with focus on profitable products',\n",
       "  'content': 'By Stephen Nellis and Subrat Patnaik\\n\\n(Reuters) - The global chip shortage has grounded major automotive factories to a halt but pushed technology giants to become more flexible by diverting existing supplies to their most profitable products, analysts and executives said.\\n\\nApple Inc said on Tuesday chip shortages had mostly affected its iPad and Mac products in its last quarter, but would start to bite into its mainstay iPhone business, its best seller and major profit driver, in the current quarter.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we\\'re dealt,\" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a post earnings conference call.\\n\\nThe comments provide an insight into how Apple, known for its deft supply chain management through long-term supply deals with Broadcom Inc and Qualcomm Inc, is dealing with the shortage ahead of the crucial holiday quarter when it sells millions of its new line of flagship phones.\\n\\nSome analysts believe Apple could be prioritizing chip supplies for its new phones during the July-September quarter, which is typically the sleepiest for iPhone sales as shoppers hold out for upcoming models.\\n\\n\"I think it largely reflects the timing of new product releases, specifically related to new iPhone launches in September,\" Angelo Zino, an analyst with research firm CFRA, said of Apple\\'s warning.\\n\\nEven in normal times, he said, \"new phone cycles typically start off supply constrained given the high demand needs ahead of the holiday selling season.\"\\n\\nAnd even within Apple\\'s current lineup, the company is likely to direct the supply chain pain to its least lucrative products, said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research.\\n\\nIts flagship phones also drive revenue from paid subscription services and accessories like AirPods.\\n\\n\"Assuming Apple prioritizes the iPhone 12 family, it probably affects iPads, Macs and older iPhones more,\" Fieldhack said.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe global chip shortage stems from a combination of factors including the fallout from last year\\'s COVID-19 shutdowns and factories struggling to meet demand for semiconductors, which have become omnipresent in an increasingly digitized world.\\n\\nThe supply squeeze took the auto industry by surprise. Car makers like Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co had to halt production lines for their popular pick-ups at a time when demand was booming as economies started to open up.\\n\\nThe auto industry relies almost exclusively on chips from a few manufacturers, so-called foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The shortage has exposed this reliance on overseas suppliers as an Achilles\\' heel for many companies.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC FOCUS\\n\\nTechnology companies, the traditional consumers of semiconductors, have been more nimble.\\n\\nChip designer Advanced Micro Devices, which makes central processor chips for PCs and data center servers, has also been redirecting supplies.\\n\\nThe company, which has a new family of chips that outperform offerings from larger rival Intel Corp, has steadily made gains in unit sales market share against the chip giant, which retains more than 80% of the overall market.\\n\\nAMD has responded to limited industry capacity by focusing on selling only its most profitable chips, leaving the lower end of the market to Intel, said Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, which tracks market share among chipmakers.\\n\\nIntel has also been struggling with its own set of challenges with manufacturing in recent years, causing it to fall behind AMD and Nvidia Corp.\\n\\n\"We\\'re focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors on a conference call.\\n\\n\"We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru and Danielle Kaye in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)',\n",

       "  'title': 'Intel vs. AMD: Which Semiconductor Stock Is a Better Pick?',\n",
       "  'content': 'Semiconductors are proving to be the engines that drive the electronics world of today, as they are being used in different applications. These include 5G, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobiles, and automotive applications.\\n\\nA Fortune Business Insights report indicated that while the semiconductor market was worth $425.96 billion last year, it is expected to grow to $803.15 billion in 2028. This indicates a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between 2021 and 2028.\\n\\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies, Intel and AMD, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.\\n\\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC)\\n\\nIntel’s products include processors that power PCs, a stand alone system-on-a-chip (SoC), a multichip package, and memory and storage products.\\n\\nIn Q2, Intel reported adjusted revenue of $18.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year, and surpassed internal guidance by $700 million. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.28, exceeding internal guidance by $0.23 and beating the consensus estimate of $1.06.\\n\\nAround two days back, INTC unveiled a process and packaging technology roadmap. The company’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, stated that Intel was accelerating its “innovation roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025.”\\n\\nIntel’s 20A process technology is expected to ramp up in 2024, while Intel 18A is currently in development and expected to debut in 2025.\\n\\nHowever, Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis reasoned that given the company’s poor execution when it came to transistors over the past five years, “which led to loss of transistor leadership in 2018, we think investors will be skeptical until INTC delivers on this plan.”\\n\\nIn other news, the company announced a new naming structure for its process nodes, “creating a clear and consistent framework to give customers a more accurate view of process nodes across the industry.”\\n\\nThe analyst noted that the new node naming structure would result in a better comparison with Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. (TSM) and Samsung and will eliminate confusion when it came to the names of the process nodes.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe analyst has a Hold rating and a price target of $52 (2.2% downside) on the stock.\\n\\nIntel also announced the first two customers for its Intel Foundry Services, including Amazon’s Web Services (AMZN) and Qualcomm (QCOM).\\n\\nThe company expects to partner with QCOM when it comes to its 20A process technology, while Amazon will be the first customer to use Intel’s packaging solutions. (See Intel stock chart on TipRanks)\\n\\nAgain, Lipacis pointed out that investors would be skeptical “here as well until these customers actually start shipping in volume.”\\n\\nHowever, the analyst believed that Intel’s advanced packaging technologies, like EMIB and Foveros, had “the potential to offer differentiated capabilities.” But Lipacis also expected that these businesses would likely “put downward pressure on INTC gross margins.”\\n\\nFor FY21, INTC plans to spend between $19 billion to $20 billion in capex. According to Lipacis, the company plans to spend $23.5 billion in capex for its facilities in Arizona and New Mexico and intends to announce more facilities in European Union and the U.S. by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe analyst thinks that this will further drag down margins in the range of 50% to 55% beyond 2021. Lipacis added, “Intel also reiterated its plans to use 3rd party foundry capacity and become a leading foundry edge foundry to serve customers globally. We believe this strategy will also prove to be dilutive to gross margins.”\\n\\nTurning to the rest of the Street, consensus is that INTC is a Hold, based on 9 Buys, 11 Holds, and 8 Sells. The average Intel price target of $60.86 implies a 14.4% upside potential to current levels.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\\n\\nYesterday, AMD delivered stellar Q2 results with revenues of $3.85 billion, a jump of 99% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings soared 250% to $0.63 per share year-over-year and beat the Street’s estimate of $0.54 per share.\\n\\nIn Q3, AMD has projected revenues of $4.1 billion (plus or minus $100 million), representing a sequential-quarterly increase of 6%, driven by solid growth in its data center and gaming businesses.\\n\\nFollowing the strong Q2 results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the price target from $107 to $110 (20.8% upside) and reiterated a Buy on the stock. Rakesh noted that AMD saw continued strength in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) demand with strong adoption for the company’s Milan data center and cross-over from its earlier generation Rome data center.\\n\\nAMD raised its non-GAAP gross margin outlook for Q3 from 47% to 48%. Based on AMD’s guidance for operating expenses (opex) to be 25% of revenues for FY21, Rakesh expects softening of operating margin in the second half of the year. (See AMD stock chart on TipRanks)\\n\\nThe analyst added, “We have noted AMD potentially needs to increase its field support to compete with INTC.”\\n\\nDatacenter revenues made up more than 20% of the company’s total revenues in Q2. Rakesh noted that meanwhile, Intel’s Q2 data center revenues were $6.5 billion, up 16% quarter-over-quarter. AMD noted at its earnings call, “We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year.”\\n\\nAnalyst Rakesh noted, “Although AMD\\'s lead times are >20 weeks vs. INTC at 1-2 weeks and we believe AMD\\'s server share gains are supply constrained heading into 2H21, AMD noted it has been making progress to alleviate constraints.”\\n\\nThe analyst stated that next year seems to be “a Server roadmap battle.”\\n\\nHe reviewed the upcoming servers from AMD’s competitors and commented, “INTC’s Sapphire Rapids delay into 1H2022 is expected to drive a better competitive roadmap and close some gaps with AMD’s Milan and 5nm Genoa, though we believe AMD currently retains the performance lead.”\\n\\nThe analyst added that he believes that AMD is well-positioned, with strong demand trends for its \"7nm [nanometer] or 5nm Server chip roadmap ahead of INTC.\"\\n\\nTurning to the rest of the Street, consensus is that AMD is a Strong Buy, based on 11 Buys and 2 Holds. The average AMD price target of $114.27 implies a 25.5% upside potential to current levels.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nWhile analysts are sidelined on Intel, they are bullish about AMD. Considering the business transformation that Intel is going through, analysts seem to be in a wait-and-watch mode with the company.\\n\\nEven Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis’s channel checks and analyses have indicated that AMD is likely to “build on its momentum from market share gains in the 1st quarter of 300bps and 150bps of CPU [central processing unit] revenue share QQ in dual servers and notebooks.”\\n\\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, AMD seems to be a better Buy.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

       "  'title': 'Bull of the Day: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)',\n",
       "  'content': 'I\\'ve been telling everyone I know about one sure-thing trade all year: buying Advanced Micro Devices AMD between $75 and $80. My conviction was so strong on this idea because I was closely watching everything competitor NVIDIA NVDA was doing and it seemed to me that AMD was doing a lot of the same things just as well, and yet the shares were trading at a significant discount to its bigger peer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI became convinced about buying AMD pullbacks a year ago in July after the stock broke-out strongly from a consolidation around $55. The catalyst was another advance in the PC wars against rival Intel INTC. I covered that in this article and video...\\r\\n\\r\\nRelease the Ryzen! AMD Roars in the Nanometer Wars\\r\\n\\r\\nI also expanded my knowledge of how the little gaming chip company had undergone an \"advanced\" semiconductor revolution in the past six years under the leadership of Taiwan-born engineer Lisa Su. Early in her career, Su worked at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor in engineering and management positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an industry outsider -- and semiconductors is a complex industry involving microscopic physics -- I was focused on how NVIDIA and fellow Taiwan engineer Jen-Hsun \"Jensen\" Huang had turned the gaming GPU chip (graphics processing unit) into the foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when I learned that Lisa Su was basically doing the same things, but with her own brands of excellence, I was hooked to learn more. And coming up, I\\'ll show you good comparisons of these two Taiwanese chip ninjas and what their teams of excellent engineers are able to create with the \"massively parallel architectures\" of GPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Surges From $80 to $105 Since June 17\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you were listening in March when I explained how I got my son and his wife to buy AMD at $75 with a resting limit order. I covered that in Flush Draw: How to Beat the Algos When They Run the Stops.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou even got a bunch more chances to buy AMD shares near $73 in the middle of May. I think part of the pessimism was over the company\\'s planned $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx XLNX and whether or not regulators would approve it. The all-stock deal for the FPGA chip maker was announced in late October and on April 7, both boards approved the deal, describing the marriage thus in the press release...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acquisition will bring together two industry leaders with complementary product portfolios and customers, combining CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Adaptive SoCs and deep software expertise to enable leadership in computing platforms for cloud, edge and end devices. Together, the combined company will have the ability to capitalize on opportunities spanning some of the industry’s most important growth segments, including data centers, gaming, PCs, communications, automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, the mood started to improve in the middle of June, even before UK and European regulators gave the deal their thumbs up. It began with a 5.5% pop in AMD shares on June 17 after the Lisa Su juggernaut announced that Alphabet GOOGL unit Google Cloud had selected AMD EPYC processors to power its new datacenters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd despite deteriorating economic and market relations with China -- which could lead one to believe that the last regulator to approve the AMD-XLNX deal might get stingy -- shares of AMD have marched to all-time highs above $100 this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nLisa & Co. Deliver the Goods\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catalyst for this week\\'s double-digit rally from $92 was another stellar beat-and-raise quarter. AMD reported second-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 63 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.7%. The bottom line soared 250% year-over-year and 21% sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues of $3.85 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.4% and surged 99% y-o-y. On a sequential basis, the top line increased 12%.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobust performance from the Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segments drove the improvements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our business performed exceptionally well in the second quarter as revenue and operating margin doubled and profitability more than tripled year-over-year,\" said AMD president and CEO Lisa Su. \"We are growing significantly faster than the market with strong demand across all of our businesses. We now expect our 2021 annual revenue to grow by approximately 60 percent year-over-year driven by strong execution and increased customer preference for our leadership products.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat full-year revenue projection comes after the prior forecast of +50%.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop-Line Growth Details\\r\\n\\r\\nComputing and Graphics segment revenues of $2.25 billion increased 65% y-o-y and 7% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to higher revenues from client processor and graphics sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in client processor average selling price (ASP) was driven by a favorable mix of Ryzen desktop and notebook processor sales. GPU ASP growth in the reported quarter was driven by strong high-end graphics product sales, including data center GPU sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD’s Ryzen Embedded Processors and RDNA 2-based GPUs are now being used by Tesla (TSLA) to power the infotainment system in its new Model S and X vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nValve announced Steam Deck powered by a semi-custom AMD processor. AMD also introduced FidelityFX Super Resolution (“FSR”), its latest spatial upscaling algorithm feature, which boosts frame rates and delivers high-quality, high-resolution gaming experiences. More than 40 game developers have already pledged support for FSR.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenues of $1.60 billion were up 183% y-o-y and 19% sequentially. The increase is attributed to higher semi-custom product sales and EPYC processor revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPYC\\'s adoption rate continued to increase in the quarter. AMD and its partners, including Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), announced several new high-performance computing systems. These include Microsoft Azure supercomputers for United Kingdom\\'s Met Office, The Perlmutter supercomputer and The Singapore National Supercomputing Centre build.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Much More Upside from $105?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment, I\\'m going to share some Wall Street analyst reactions and their price target bumps for AMD. But I\\'ll tell you right now that quite a few are sticky around $110. Some outliers see $125 and one is even targeting $150.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo can you still invest in AMD here even if you missed the good buys near $80? I think so and not only am I not selling any of my shares, I\\'ll be looking to add on dips. For more insight into why I think this way, check out these two recent articles and videos I produced...\\r\\n\\r\\nAI Dreams and Reality: Investing in Advanced Technology\\r\\n\\r\\nNVIDIA and AMD: Digital Flywheels of Super-Exponential Innovation\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysts Chime In\\r\\n\\r\\nHere were select comments and price target (PT) moves by Wall Street semiconductor analysts...\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferies: Analyst Mark Lipacis kept AMD as one of his top picks and reiterated his $110 PT. Lipacis has over 2 decades experience in analysis of the semiconductor industry and he convinced me last year how quickly NVIDIA was going to ramp its datacenter business to be bigger than gaming, especially if the proposed ARM Holdings acquisition goes through. Now he sees AMD server share gains accelerating to be greater than 25% of their business this year. Lipacis estimates AMD server CPU revenues increased by 33% quarter-over-quarter, compared to 16% for Intel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMizuho: Analyst Vijay Rakesh raised the firm\\'s PT on AMD to $110 from $107 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares after the \"strong\" June quarter results. However, the analyst believes investors may be starting to get concerned over the 2022 and 2023 PC outlook. So here\\'s a bull who was right all year heading into this quarter, but now is getting cautious and would probably be advising his clients to take some profits as the stock busts through $105 as I type on Thursday afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusquehanna: Analyst Christopher Rolland raised his PT on AMD to $130 from $125 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst said he anticipated upside results and guidance but he had not expected the company to navigate supply constraints flawlessly and raise full year expectations. Another AMD bull who stays very bullish.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaymond James: The analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and $110 PT, citing the unexpected boost in guidance being driven mainly by the server business. Their analysis, based on Intel and AMD guidance, suggests that AMD is poised to take about 2% server share in each of 3Q and 4Q, in contrast to Intel’s expectations to hold server share in 2H21. \"And that’s before AMD launches the more powerful Genoa server platform, for which we expect significant incremental performance gains since that product will move to the TSMC N5 node.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat bit of industry code at the end refers to Taiwan Semiconductor and 5-nanometer technology. The RJ analysts sum up the competitive edge of AMD vs INTC: \"Since Intel’s recent roadmap indicates that AMD will be working with a transistor advantage at least through 2024, we think AMD simply needs to continue doing what they’re doing and the market share will come their way.\" They raised their 2022 EPS estimates to $3.08 while the Zacks Consensus stood at $2.70 before the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthland: Analyst Gus Richard raised his PT to $125 per share, noting \"All product lines are driving growth and AMD is winning higher margin SKUs. We believe AMD outperformance is drive by superior products built on a superior manufacturing process. We do not expect this advantage to diminish any time soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRosenblatt: Analyst Hans Mosesmann hiked his PT to $150 per share from $135 following “another big beat-and-raise” quarter. “This time is even more compelling given industry supply chain shortages and an increasingly more vulnerable Intel (weaker portfolio and delays of next generation CPUs). AMD took up sales growth for 2021 to the 60% level from 50% (and 37% from January) on broad-based demand and share gains on everything they offer, literally. All new 5nm roadmap confirmed on-track for 2022.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let\\'s check in with a recalcitrant bear...\\r\\n\\r\\nBMO Capital: Analyst Ambrish Srivastava raised the firm\\'s PT on AMD to $80 from $75 but kept an Underperform rating on the shares. Despite strong Q2 results and guidance, with growth in the server \"side business\" remaining robust, the analyst believes AMD still faces a \"re-energized\" Intel and its market share gains will likely moderate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I\\'ve been saying all year, what bears don\\'t get is that AMD is the #2 supplier behind NVIDIA in hyperscale datacenter... and #1 if you ask Google. Plus it trades at less than half NVDA\\'s 17X sales valuation. Buy the dips in AMD.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you\\'ll get some (I hope), just like we did from $95 last winter down to $75. Maybe the next market pullback will give you another shot at $95. Maybe.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"AMD's Q2 Results Have All The Chips In Place\",\n",
       "  'content': \"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have been rising after the semiconductor company reported its second-quarter earnings that beat analyst predictions with a stick. AMD reported its seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth on Tuesday, leaving Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) trading flat to lower on Wednesday. The surge in AMD's both revenue and earnings, driven by the ongoing global semiconductor shortage that has driven up both demand and prices for chips that go in everything, from cars and home appliances to children's toys, wasn't enough to bring other chips and graphics card makers in for the ride.\\n\\nQ2 Figures\\n\\nIf we look at pro forma figures, instead of earning $0.54 per share on sales of barely $3.6 billion as expected by analysts, AMD reported a $0.63-per-share profit on sales that amounted to $3.85 billion. When looking at GAAP figures, numbers aren't quite as good but they are still good enough. Sales doubled YoY, rising 99% from last year's figure. Operating profit margin more than doubled to 22%. As for the bottom line, profit amounted to $0.58 per share, up 346% from last year's $0.13 per share.\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nUpdating guidance for the quarter to come, AMD updated its third-quarter guidance, expecting revenue at about plus or minus $100 million of $4.1 billion, which would imply a 6% improvement compared to Q2 numbers, 46% growth compared to last year ago, and well ahead of analysts forecast that estimated $3.8 billion. Sales of chips to the data center and gaming businesses is expected to keep driving growth with AMD planning to maintain its current 48% gross profit margin in both the undergoing and the whole of 2021.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nFor its second quarter, AMD reported 99% YoY growth in revenue driven by 65% YOY growth in its computing and graphics segment and 183% YoY in its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment. It also increased its guidance, now expecting 60% YoY growth for 2021. The chipmaker reported its fifth straight quarter of record server processor revenue due to the strong demand for its Epyc processor after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) reported a decline in its data center group last week. The demand for graphic cards is still high so as good as Q2 was, Q3 could be even better for AMD.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThis article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

       "  'title': 'Advanced Micro (AMD) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?',\n",
       "  'content': \"Have you been paying attention to shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $106.97 in the previous session. Advanced Micro Devices has gained 15.8% since the start of the year compared to the 22.1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 14.9% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.\\n\\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\\n\\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 27, 2021, Advanced Micro reported EPS of $0.63 versus consensus estimate of $0.54 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.35%.\\n\\nFor the current fiscal year, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $2.5 per share on $15.67 billion in revenues. This represents a 93.8% change in EPS on a 60.45% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.07 per share on $17.85 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 22.62% and 13.97%, respectively.\\n\\nValuation Metrics\\n\\nAdvanced Micro may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\\n\\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 42.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 77.1X versus its peer group's average of 18.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.95. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\\n\\nZacks Rank\\n\\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Advanced Micro currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\\n\\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Advanced Micro fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Advanced Micro shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, we will take a look at how good of a profit making machine is AMD.\\n\\nBy comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\\n\\nDuring the last half decade, Advanced Micro Devices became profitable.That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.\\n\\nSince the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too.\\n\\nIndeed, the Advanced Micro Devices share price has gained 459% in three years.Meanwhile, EPS is up 126% per year.This EPS growth is higher than the 77% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years.Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.\\n\\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\\n\\nIt is of course excellent to see how Advanced Micro Devices has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.If you are thinking of buying or selling Advanced Micro Devices stock, you should check out this FREEdetailed report on its balance sheet.\\n\\nAfter the recent earnings report, we have seen just how strongly AMD came with earnings:\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRevenue US$3.85b, up 99% year over year, and beating the US$3.65 estimate Operating (EBIT) margin 22% EPS US$0.63 beating the US$0.54 estimate Net Income US$710m, up 352% year over year\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nAMD has been firing on all cylinders this quarter and pushed production to the limits. They are managing demand, expanding capacity and introducing new products such as the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT.\\n\\nIt is fair to also mention the risks for AMD:\\n\\nOn the 3rd August 2021 China issued a statement announcing to launch an investigation into chipmakers for the automotive industry and severely punish price gauging, hoarding and driving up prices. This has the potential to affect companies that supply AMD with parts and products. AMD has major competitors such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), that have more resources and respective market share, and may engage in aggressive campaigns that have the potential to materially affect AMD's performance. AMD's stock price has recently hit an all-time high based on their strong quarterly report, it is natural to expect some downwards volatility in the short term, as the market adjusts and stabilizes the price.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices provided a stock return of 40% over the year. That's fairly close to the broader market return.\\n\\nA great quarter has prompted a surge in the price, which may be volatile in the short term.\\n\\nAMD is increasing its bottom line and starting to accumulate serious profits that will attract investors. This is a great change from a few years ago when the company wasn't profitable. The company is forecasted to remain profitable, and analysts may revise their estimates based on this quarter's performance.\\n\\nTo understand Advanced Micro Devices better, we need to consider many other factors.To that end, you should learn about the  3 warning signs  we've spotted with Advanced Micro Devices (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .\\n\\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\\n\\nAnalysts' growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this chipmaker is driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- has this insight at its core.\\n\\nThe five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.\\n\\nConsensus earnings estimates for the next quarter and full year have moved considerably higher for Advanced Micro, as there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising estimates.\\n\\nCurrent-Quarter Estimate Revisions\\n\\nFor the current quarter, the company is expected to earn $0.66 per share, which is a change of +60.98% from the year-ago reported number.\\n\\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advanced Micro has increased 23.36% because 11 estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisions.\\n\\nCurrent-Year Estimate Revisions\\n\\nThe company is expected to earn $2.50 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +93.8% from the prior-year number.\\n\\nThe revisions trend for the current year also appears quite promising for Advanced Micro, with 13 estimates moving higher over the past month compared to no negative revisions. The consensus estimate has also received a boost over this time frame, increasing 19.18%.\\n\\nFavorable Zacks Rank\\n\\nThe promising estimate revisions have helped Advanced Micro earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&P 500.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nInvestors have been betting on Advanced Micro because of its solid estimate revisions, as evident from the stock's 14.7% gain over the past four weeks.

       "  'content': 'Stocks continue to hover near their highs as we head into August and continue to chip away through earnings season. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades for Tuesday.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: General Electric (GE) Top stock trades for GE\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) began trading Monday after its 1-for-8 reverse stock split, sending shares from the $12 to $14 range up toward $100. Unfortunately, GE stock fell about 3% on the day.\\n\\nGE had billions of shares in outstanding stock, so I get the reverse split. But it seems like reverse splitting up toward $100 was the wrong way to do it. Why now a 1-for-6 split and open the stock in the mid-$70s? That way $100 acts as a target.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter now — this is the situation the stock is in regardless of our opinion.\\n\\nShares are fading from the 50-day moving average as well, something that was occurring last week after earnings despite solid results.\\n\\nNow we must keep an eye on the $96 to $98 area, as well as the 200-day moving average. That may afford bulls a decent dip-buying opportunity should the stock get there.\\n\\nOn the upside, however, $115 becomes the next target if the stock is able to push above the 50-day moving average.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nIt’s crazy that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell on earnings, despite strong results and an impressive outlook. Or the fact that it was due for a rally after a year of consolidation, while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was sitting near new highs.\\n\\nIn any regard, we’ve now received four robust days of upside action. Some people ribbed me when I said $115 could be in play, that being the 161.8% extension. Of course to get there, we needed a push to new highs and above $100.\\n\\nWell we’ve got that and some. I would be trimming some of this AMD stock position if I were long it as a trade and look for $115 on a further push. Aside from that, this one is now a buy-on-dips candidate going forward.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSpecifically, I’m talking about declines to the 10-day moving average, followed by the $99 to $100 area.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: ContextLogic (WISH) Top stock trades for WISH\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nShares of ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) are making some noise today, jumping about 5% in Monday’s trading session. The stock has suffered a hard fade from its highs earlier in the year, but has done a good job to break out over downtrend resistance (blue line).\\n\\nThe prior support area near $15 has now turned into resistance. Following the latest dip, WISH stock held the $9 level and is trying to push through several key moving averages.\\n\\nIf shares can reclaim the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, it could put another move up toward $15 in play.\\n\\nOf course, if it can’t do so and these moving averages act as resistance, then $9 is back on the table. On a close below $9, the $7.50 to $8 zone becomes a potential area of interest.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Alibaba (BABA) Top stock trades for BABA\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nLast but most certainly not least is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Investors remain concerned about this one as Chinese regulators continue to crack down on tech stocks.\\n\\nHowever, the situation is a bit more complex than that. Not only is Alibaba due to report earnings on Tuesday morning, but the stock is now rebounding back to its prior breakdown spot.\\n\\nOn the weekly chart here, notice the stock’s aggressive bounce from last week’s low as it now pushes back up toward $200 and the 200-week moving average. It’s also rallying back to prior downtrend support (blue line).\\n\\nThis could be setting up as a short-term make-or-break situation. Back over $200 could trigger a move to the $210 area and the 10-week moving average. Above that puts the 21-week moving average in play. Perhaps more importantly though, that type of rally would give prior support the chance to be support again. That’s in reference to the breakdown area I mentioned earlier (near $200).\\n\\nIf the post-earnings reaction is bearish, though, last week’s low is on the table near $180. A close below that could put the March 2020 low on the table near $170 and it would mean that prior support ($200-ish) is now resistance.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in AMD and NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\\n\\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.\\n\\nMore From InvestorPlace\\n\\nStock Prodigy Who Found NIO at $2… Says Buy THIS Now  Analyst Who Found Microsoft at $0.38 Names #1 Pick for the AI Boom  America’s #1 EV Stock Still Flying Under the Radar\\n\\nThe post 4 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: GE, AMD, WISH, BABA appeared first on InvestorPlace.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Last week, I wrote about Advanced Micro Devices AMD as the Bull of the Day after another stellar earnings report and guidance handed my followers big new-high gains above $95.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a long-time investor in bigger peer NVIDIA NVDA, I talked about how I finally became an AMD fan last summer when they stunned the semiconductor world with Intel-clobbering advances in all product segments. Here\\'s what I wrote last week...\\r\\n\\r\\nI became convinced about buying AMD pullbacks a year ago in July after the stock broke-out strongly from a consolidation around $55. The catalyst was another advance in the PC wars against rival Intel. I covered that in this article and video...\\r\\n\\r\\nRelease the Ryzen! AMD Roars in the Nanometer Wars\\r\\n\\r\\nI also expanded my knowledge of how the little gaming chip company had undergone an \"advanced\" semiconductor revolution in the past six years under the leadership of Taiwan-born engineer Lisa Su. Early in her career, Su worked at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor in engineering and management positions.\\r\\n\\r\\n(end of excerpt from AMD: Bull of the Day)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne part of the story I left out was what happened on that fateful day of July 24, 2020: while INTC shares dropped 16%, AMD surged an equal amount on a massive 205 million shares.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason I bring that up now is to highlight the volume we are seeing in AMD in the past week. In the video that accompanies this article, I show the price chart with volume and what you see looks like this...\\r\\n\\r\\n28 July: 140M shares\\r\\n29 July: 164M shares\\r\\n30 July: 125M shares\\r\\n02 Aug: 115M shares\\r\\n03 Aug: 158M shares\\r\\n04 Aug: 181M shares (as I type with 2 hours to go till the closing bell!)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor perspective, the average daily volume for AMD is somewhere in the neighborhood of only 60 million shares. This is double and triple volume every day for six days straight!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this ramp as the stock ascends to $120 today -- partly off of yesterday\\'s press release that AMD is providing the Radeon Pro W6000X series GPUs for the Apple Mac Pro -- is a combination of institutions who ignored AMD stock at $80 for the past year and short-sellers who simply had no idea what they were doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new AMD product line, which includes Radeon Pro W6800X and Pro W6900X, is built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture and AMD Infinity Cache, among other technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD Good, AMC Bad\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you may know, I like to have some fun when I write about stocks and share good research. My first priority is the research and helping my followers buy good stocks and stay with them. Once I\\'ve done that, we can have a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one of the best places for laughs lately is the StockTwits message board for AMC Entertainment AMC, where an army of apes believes they are going to teach hedge funds a lesson and get rich as the stock goes to $1,000... or was it $100,000?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll year, I\\'ve tried to tell them that \"there are no armies in trading.\" It\\'s just you, your capital, your risk/reward management, and your mental discipline against the market. One of my biggest and sincere concerns is that the \"ape army\" philosophy is seductive and damaging to inexperienced traders who might believe all the revolutionary fervor and prophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MOASS (mother of all short squeezes) is a fun idea, but it is not a reliable trading strategy. When it ends, it will end badly for many small traders.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, you don\\'t really know who is selling when all you see are 300 messages per minute fly by about how \"WE ARE WINNING BECAUSE WE ARE NEVER SELLING!!\" (rocket emoji, ape emoji, moon emoji, etc)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, I made one last appeal to common sense and decency with AMC FUD Runneth Over: Panic at the Casino! to persuade folks to let go of the fantasy of reforming Wall Street and just focus on becoming better investors and traders with stocks like AMD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apes all respond that I must be getting paid by Citadel to keep AMC down. But really, I was trying to help them get paid!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could have still bought AMD near $80 and sold AMC near $60 on June 21. Now one is up +35% and the other is down -40%. I\\'ll let you guess which is which.\\r\\n\\r\\nNVDA and SQ: Always Buy, Never Sell\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spirt of good humor, I will admit that even I sometimes get a little fanatical about my favorite stocks. I discuss two more of them in the video, explaining first why NVDA should have gone down today, but it did not. Which is wonderful. The news this morning was that UK regulators might block Jensen Huang\\'s proposed $40 billion buyout of Arm Holdings. Get the details in the video.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for Square SQ, I went back to my research notes and explained why the \"Apple of FinTech\" just keeps getting better and stronger at providing a rich ecosystem of services and tools for the small business person. It\\'s really a wonder to behold what Jack Dorsey is doing and why.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to watch the video to learn why I call Square \"Jamie Dimon\\'s Favorite Mistake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Quick Stroll Through the Reddit Rabbit Neighborhood\\r\\n\\r\\nTo wrap up my quick tour through some of the best stocks in my neighborhood, I also took a look at a more controversial investment choice, namely Robinhood HOOD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stock soared as much as 80% this morning to $85 and we don\\'t know all the details yet as to why -- except that Cathie Wood\\'s ARK Invest has been buying every day since the IPO late last week.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut part of the story is that the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd was a collective hater of the IPO for obvious reasons involving PFOF (payment for order flow) and other conspiratorial shenanigans with hedge funds like Citadel to keep AMC stock down.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the wascally wabbit-hole bettors were encouraging their armies to be short HOOD, twas a very \"steal from the poor and give to the rich\" sort of thing to do, especially as the shares head back to $70 while I type at 2:30 ET on Wednesday. I don\\'t know. Maybe WSB-ers were buyers of the HOOD.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut another angle from one of my options pros, Dave Borun, is that since options started trading today on HOOD and the retail crowd is out there euphorically buying high-strike, out-of-the-money calls, market makers had to buy up the shares at any price to cover their risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said there are virtually no shares available to borrow which means nobody can really short the stock and keep a lid on the insanity. So the 70-strike calls, as the highest available strike on the board, had an insane implied volatility of 250%.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t wait to hear all the stories behind the stories soon. But one cool thing I didn\\'t know is that Robinhood account holders had a chance to buy shares pre-IPO.\\r\\n\\r\\nSquare did that too and my family took full advantage. It\\'s especially smart for the swashbuckling new broker because they now have a richer class of clientele who will sell some shares and buy more of other stocks in their accounts. The pure genius of merry pranksters.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure: I own AMD, NVDA, and SQ for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Shares Climb 25% But Its Business Is Yet to Catch Up\",\n",
       "  'content': 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 25% gain in the last month alone. Looking back a bit further, it\\'s encouraging to see the stock is up 39% in the last year.\\n\\nSince its price has surged higher, given close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E\\'s\") below 17x, you may consider Advanced Micro Devices as a stock to avoid entirely with its 41.7x P/E ratio. Although, it\\'s not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it\\'s so lofty.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices certainly has been doing a good job lately as it\\'s been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You\\'d really hope so, otherwise you\\'re paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices  pe\\n\\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Advanced Micro Devices will help you uncover what\\'s on the horizon.\\n\\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\\n\\nThere\\'s an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Advanced Micro Devices\\' to be considered reasonable.\\n\\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 437%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 1,053% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.\\n\\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 3.9% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 13% growth each year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.\\n\\nWith this information, we find it concerning that Advanced Micro Devices is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren\\'t willing to let go of their stock at any price. There\\'s a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Final Word\\n\\nShares in Advanced Micro Devices have built up some good momentum lately, which has really inflated its P/E. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\\n\\nOur examination of Advanced Micro Devices\\' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn\\'t impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren\\'t likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders\\' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.\\n\\nAnd what about other risks? Every company has them, and we\\'ve spotted  3 warning signs for Advanced Micro Devices  (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.\\n\\nIf P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this freecollection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E\\'s below 20x.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

       "  'content': \"Hedge funds and large money managers usually invest with a focus on the long-term horizon and, therefore, short-lived dips or bumps on the charts usually don't make them change their opinion towards a company. This time it may be different. The coronavirus pandemic destroyed the high correlations among major industries and asset classes. We are now in a stock pickers market where fundamentals of a stock have more effect on the price than the overall direction of the market. As a result we observe sudden and large changes in hedge fund positions depending on the news flow. Let’s take a look at the hedge fund sentiment towards Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to find out whether there were any major changes in hedge funds' views.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a decrease in hedge fund interest lately. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was in 62 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 74. Our calculations also showed that AMD isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).\\n\\nIn the 21st century investor’s toolkit there are numerous tools stock market investors have at their disposal to size up stocks. A pair of the most underrated tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the elite hedge fund managers can outpace the S&P 500 by a healthy margin (see the details here). Also, our monthly newsletter's portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points. You can download a sample issue of this newsletter on our website . Donald Sussman Paloma Partners\\n\\nDonald Sussman of Paloma Partners\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind we're going to analyze the key hedge fund action regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think AMD Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nAt Q1's end, a total of 62 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -16% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 62 hedge funds with a bullish position in AMD a year ago. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.\\n\\nMore specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with a stake worth $1432 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was Fisher Asset Management, which amassed a stake valued at $747.8 million. Arrowstreet Capital, Citadel Investment Group, and Sylebra Capital Management were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Sylebra Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), around 8.64% of its 13F portfolio. Andar Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 7.45 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AMD.\\n\\nSeeing as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a decline in interest from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, we can see that there exists a select few hedge funds who sold off their positions entirely last quarter. Interestingly, Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners dropped the largest investment of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, comprising close to $553.7 million in stock, and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $368.2 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as total hedge fund interest was cut by 12 funds last quarter.\\n\\nLet's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). We will take a look at Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), Vale SA (NYSE:VALE), British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI), and Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM). This group of stocks' market caps resemble AMD's market cap.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position MO,38,1109493,1 ZM,54,5672277,-5 SYK,46,3154010,2 GSK,25,1359731,-5 VALE,31,2615665,-4 BTI,14,1034777,4 ANTM,58,5373054,-12 Average,38,2902715,-2.7 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 38 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $2903 million. That figure was $3703 million in AMD's case. Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AMD is 68.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks returned 25.8% in 2021 through August 6th but still managed to beat the market by 6.7 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on AMD as the stock returned 40.3% since the end of March (through 8/6) and outperformed the market by an even larger margin. Hedge funds were clearly right about piling into this stock relative to other stocks with similar market capitalizations.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n10 Best Automotive Stocks to Invest in Now Maplelane’s Top 10 Stock Holdings How Amazon Makes Money\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was in 62 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 74. Our calculations also showed that AMD isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).\\n\\nIn the 21st century investor’s toolkit there are numerous tools stock market investors have at their disposal to size up stocks. A pair of the most underrated tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the elite hedge fund managers can outpace the S&P 500 by a healthy margin (see the details here).

Keeping this in mind we're going to analyze the key hedge fund action regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think AMD Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nAt Q1's end, a total of 62 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -16% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 62 hedge funds with a bullish position in AMD a year ago. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.\\n\\nMore specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with a stake worth $1432 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was Fisher Asset Management, which amassed a stake valued at $747.8 million. Arrowstreet Capital, Citadel Investment Group, and Sylebra Capital Management were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Sylebra Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), around 8.64% of its 13F portfolio. Andar Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 7.45 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AMD.\\n\\nSeeing as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced a decline in interest from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, we can see that there exists a select few hedge funds who sold off their positions entirely last quarter. Interestingly, Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners dropped the largest investment of all the hedgies monitored by Insider Monkey, comprising close to $553.7 million in stock, and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $368.2 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as total hedge fund interest was cut by 12 funds last quarter.\\n\\nLet's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). We will take a look at Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK), Vale SA (NYSE:VALE), British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI), and Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM). This group of stocks' market caps resemble AMD's market cap.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position MO,38,1109493,1 ZM,54,5672277,-5 SYK,46,3154010,2 GSK,25,1359731,-5 VALE,31,2615665,-4 BTI,14,1034777,4 ANTM,58,5373054,-12 Average,38,2902715,-2.7 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 38 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $2903 million. That figure was $3703 million in AMD's case. Anthem Inc (NYSE:ANTM) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI) is the least popular one with only 14 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AMD is 68.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks returned 25.8% in 2021 through August 6th but still managed to beat the market by 6.7 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on AMD as the stock returned 40.3% since the end of March (through 8/6) and outperformed the market by an even larger margin. Hedge funds were clearly right about piling into this stock relative to other stocks with similar market capitalizations.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n10 Best Automotive Stocks to Invest in Now Maplelane’s Top 10 Stock Holdings How Amazon Makes Money\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

       "  'title': 'Advanced Micro (AMD) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?',\n",
       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\\n\\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\\n\\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\\n\\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Advanced Micro is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\\n\\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\\n\\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\\n\\nFor Advanced Micro, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\\n\\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Advanced Micro\\n\\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2021, this chipmaker is expected to earn $2.50 per share, which is a change of 93.8% from the year-ago reported number.\\n\\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Advanced Micro. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.2%.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\\n\\nThe upgrade of Advanced Micro to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': \"Here's Why Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy\",\n",
       "  'content': 'Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock\\'s recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the \\'long\\' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\\n\\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\\n\\nBelow, we take a look at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Advanced Micro Devices currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\\n\\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\\n\\nSet to Beat the Market?\\n\\nIn order to see if AMD is a promising momentum pick, let\\'s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this chipmaker holds up.\\n\\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor AMD, shares are up 0.4% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is down 2.02% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 28.71% compares favorably with the industry\\'s 1.98% performance as well.\\n\\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Advanced Micro Devices have risen 43.26%, and are up 35.98% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 9.05% and 34.08%, respectively.\\n\\nInvestors should also take note of AMD\\'s average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AMD is averaging 97,568,424 shares for the last 20 days.\\n\\nEarnings Outlook\\n\\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with AMD.\\n\\nOver the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMD\\'s consensus estimate, increasing from $2.16 to $2.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AMD is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you\\'ve been searching for a fresh pick that\\'s set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Advanced Micro Devices on your short list.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A sweeper pays the market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.\\n\\nThese types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.\\n\\nThe AMD Trades: Below is a look at the notable options alerts, courtesy of Benzinga Pro:\\n\\nAt 10:03 a.m., a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 1000 Advanced Micro Devices options with a strike price of $115 expiring on Aug. 27.

A key lab is waiting for a larger supercomputer from Intel that got delayed. Intel's supercomputer for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago was touted as U.S.' fastest computer when announced in 2019. Nvidia and AMD's Polaris will come online this year and serve as a test machine for Argonne to prepare its software for Intel's device.

Shares have added about 10.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\\n\\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Advanced Micro due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\\n\\nAMD Beats on Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Raises '21 Outlook\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported second-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 63 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.7%. The bottom line soared 250% year over year and 21% sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues of $3.85 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.4% and surged 99% year over year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the top line increased 12%.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobust performance from the Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segments drove year-over-year improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD raised its 2021 guidance for revenues and gross margin on the back of strong growth across all businesses.

The buyout is expected to conclude by the end of 2021.\\n\\nTop-Line Details\\n\\nComputing and Graphics segment revenues of $2.25 billion increased 65% year over year and 7% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to higher revenues from client processor and graphics sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in client processor average selling price (“ASP”) was driven by a favorable mix of Ryzen desktop and notebook processor sales. GPU ASP growth in the reported quarter was driven by strong high-end graphics product sales, including data center GPU sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD’s Ryzen Embedded Processors and RDNA 2-based GPUs are now being used by Tesla to power the infotainment system in its new Model S and X vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nValve announced Steam Deck powered by a semi-custom AMD processor.

AMD and its partners, including Microsoft and Alphabet, announced several new high-performance computing systems. These include Microsoft Azure supercomputers for United Kingdom’s Met Office, The Perlmutter supercomputer and The Singapore National Supercomputing Centre supercomputer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle Cloud and AMD announced a new instance (T2D) based on Third-Gen EPYC processors. The company’s second-gen EPYC processors are powering the new HPE Alletra 6000 storage solutions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOperating Details\\n\\nNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 400 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 200 bps sequentially, to 48%. The gross margin expansion was primarily driven by a richer mix of sales, particularly due to strong demand for high-end Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 47% year over year and 10% quarter over quarter to $909 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 24% was significantly better than the year-ago quarter’s 12%. Sequentially, operating margin expanded 200 bps.\\r\\n\\r\\nSegment wise, Computing and Graphics operating income was $526 million, up 163% year over year and 8.5% sequentially, courtesy of higher revenues. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $398 million, significantly higher than year-ago quarter’s figure of $33 million. Sequentially, the figure increased 43.7%.\\n\\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\\n\\nAs of Jun 26, 2021, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $3.79 billion compared with $3.12 billion as of Mar 27, 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of Jun 26, 2021, total debt (long-term plus short-term) was $313 million, down from $314 million as of Mar 27, 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperating cash flow was reported at $952 million compared with $898 million in first-quarter 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree cash flow was $888 million in the second quarter compared with $832 million in first-quarter 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD announced a share repurchase program worth $4 billion in the reported quarter.\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\nAMD expects third-quarter 2021 revenues to be $4.1 billion (+/-$100 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 46% and quarter-over-quarter improvement of 6%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year-over-year growth is expected to be driven by robust sales across all its businesses. The sequential increase is projected to be led by growth across data center and gaming verticals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 48%.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2021, AMD now expects revenues to increase 60% year over year, compared with the prior-projected growth of 50%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 revenues is pegged at $14.71 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 50.7%.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD now expects non-GAAP gross margin for 2021 to be 48%, up from the previous guidance of 47%.\\n\\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\\n\\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. The consensus estimate has shifted 22.86% due to these changes.\\n\\nVGM Scores\\n\\nCurrently, Advanced Micro has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\\n\\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Advanced Micro has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Along with AMD\\'s processors, the supercomputer will use Nvidia\\'s GPUs.\\n\\nIn addition, Cloudflare is pushing for AMD\\'s products as well, as they stated that the power consumption was significantly lower compared to Intel\\'s alternatives. While retail clients might have brand preferences, when it comes to large-scale server operations, power consumption is a significant variable in the overall profitability equation.\\n\\nAnalyzing ROE\\n\\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company\\'s management is utilizing the company\\'s capital.Simply put, it is used to assess a company\\'s profitability concerning its equity capital.\\n\\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\\n\\nThe formula for return on equity is:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\\' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is:\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n49% = US$3.4b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021).\\n\\nThe \"return\" is the yearly profit.\\n\\nSo, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder\\'s investments, the company generates a profit of $0.49.\\n\\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\\n\\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\\'s future earnings.Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain,\" we can evaluate a company\\'s future ability to generate profits.\\n\\nAssuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the company\\'s growth rate compared to companies that don\\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices\\' Earnings Growth And 49% ROE\\n\\nFirst thing first, Advanced Micro Devices has an impressive ROE.Additionally, the company\\'s ROE is higher than the industry average of 15%, which is remarkable.\\n\\nAs a result, Advanced Micro Devices\\' exceptional 81% net income growth was seen over the past five years doesn\\'t come as a surprise.\\n\\nWe then compared Advanced Micro Devices\\' net income growth with the industry, and we\\'re pleased to see that the company\\'s growth figure is higher when compared with the industry, which has a growth rate of 16% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\\n\\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. An investor needs to know whether the market has priced in the company\\'s expected earnings growth (or decline).\\n\\nBy doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.If you\\'re wondering about Advanced Micro Devices\\'\\'s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOn the whole, we feel that Advanced Micro Devices\\' performance has been quite good.Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This, of course, has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.\\n\\nGiven the exceptional returns, it is also not surprising that the company is not paying a dividend yet, but we can expect that down the road as the expansion slows down and returns move closer to the mean.\\n\\nHaving said that, the company\\'s earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecast in the current analyst estimates.To know more about the company\\'s future earnings growth forecasts, take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts to find out more.\\n\\nSimply Wall St analyst Stjepan Kalinic and Simply Wall St have no position in any of the companies mentioned.

The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price.

       "  'content': \"Before we spend countless hours researching a company, we like to analyze what insiders, hedge funds and billionaire investors think of the stock first. This is a necessary first step in our investment process because our research has shown that the elite investors' consensus returns have been exceptional. In the following paragraphs, we find out what the billionaire investors and hedge funds think of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders have witnessed an increase in hedge fund sentiment lately. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was in 63 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic is 74. There were 62 hedge funds in our database with AMD positions at the end of the first quarter. Our calculations also showed that AMD isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings).\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 79 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings. Mark Kingdon - Kingdon Capital\\n\\nMark Kingdon of Kingdon Capital\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind we're going to go over the recent hedge fund action surrounding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

       "  'content': 'SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept.  29, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced a goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency for AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct accelerators in Artificial Intelligence (AI) training and High Performance Computing (HPC) applications running on accelerated compute nodes by 2025.1 Accomplishing this ambitious goal will require AMD to increase the energy efficiency of a compute node at a rate that is more than 2.5x faster than the aggregate industry-wide improvement made during the last five years.2\\n\\nAccelerated compute nodes are the most powerful and advanced computing systems in the world used for scientific research and large-scale supercomputer simulations. They provide the computing capability used by scientists to achieve breakthroughs across many fields including material sciences, climate predictions, genomics, drug discovery and alternative energy. Accelerated nodes are also integral for training AI neural networks that are currently used for activities including speech recognition, language translation and expert recommendation systems, with similar promising uses over the coming decade. The 30x goal would save billions of kilowatt hours of electricity in 2025, reducing the power required for these systems to complete a single calculation by 97% over five years.\\n\\n“Achieving gains in processor energy efficiency is a long-term design priority for AMD and we are now setting a new goal for modern compute nodes using our high-performance CPUs and accelerators when applied to AI training and high-performance computing deployments,” said Mark Papermaster, executive vice president and CTO, AMD. “Focused on these very important segments and the value proposition for leading companies to enhance their environmental stewardship, AMD’s 30x goal outpaces industry energy efficiency performance in these areas by 150% compared to the previous five-year time period.”\\n\\n“With computing becoming ubiquitous from edge to core to cloud, AMD has taken a bold position on the energy efficiency of its processors, this time for the accelerated compute for AI and\\xa0High Performance Computing applications,” said Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360 Research. “Future gains are more difficult now as the\\xa0historical advantages that come with Moore’s Law have greatly diminished. A 30-times improvement in energy efficiency in five years will be an\\xa0impressive technical achievement that will demonstrate the strength of AMD technology and their emphasis on environmental\\xa0sustainability.”\\n\\nIncreased energy efficiency for accelerated computing applications is part of the company’s new goals in Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) spanning its operations, supply chain and products. For more than twenty-five years, AMD has been transparently reporting on its environmental stewardship and performance. For its recent achievements in product energy efficiency, AMD was named to Fortune’s Change the World list in 2020 that recognizes outstanding efforts by companies to tackle society’s unmet\\xa0needs.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nIn addition to compute node performance/Watt measurements3, to make the goal particularly relevant to worldwide energy use, AMD uses segment-specific datacenter power utilization effectiveness (PUE) with equipment utilization taken into account.3 The energy consumption baseline uses the same industry energy per operation improvement rates as from 2015-2020, extrapolated to 2025. The measure of energy per operation improvement in each segment from 2020-2025 is weighted by the projected worldwide volumes4 multiplied by the Typical Energy Consumption (TEC) of each computing segment to arrive at a meaningful metric of actual energy usage improvement worldwide.\\n\\nDr. Jonathan Koomey, President, Koomey Analytics, said “The energy efficiency goal set by AMD for accelerated compute nodes used for AI training and High Performance Computing fully reflects modern workloads, representative operating behaviors and accurate benchmarking methodology.”\\n\\nSupporting Resources\\n\\nLearn more about AMD EPYC ProcessorsLearn more about the AMD Instinct AcceleratorsLearn more about AMD corporate responsibilityLearn more about the AMD 25x20 Energy Efficiency InitiativeBecome a fan of AMD on FacebookFollow AMD on Twitter\\n\\nAbout AMD\\n\\nFor more than 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies ― the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms and the datacenter.

       "  'title': 'AMD’s (NASDAQ:AMD) Upside Potential May be Limited in the Medium Term',\n",
       "  'content': \"This article originally appeared on Simply Wall St News.\\n\\nThe stock price of Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) has been going through a correction for the last two months. There has been a lot of attention on the stock recently in anticipation of a resumption of the bullish trend - although an initial breakout was derailed by yesterday’s market wide sell-off.\\n\\nIf the recent low of $99.51 holds, another break to the upside is very likely. We think investors may need to manage expectations regarding how much follow through such a move would have. On the other hand, if the stock price continues to fall, it would offer a better entry point with a more reasonable valuation.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nWhat's the opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices?\\n\\nAccording to our estimate of AMD’s fair value, which is $82.24, the stock is overvalued by about 23%. This estimate is based on earnings forecasts and is sensitive to any changes in those forecasts and the discount rate ( more on this estimate her e). This premium isn’t a big deal for a company that has grown revenue by 465% over the last five years. But it may become an issue when we look at growth forecasts for the next few years.\\n\\nAs the chart below illustrates, AMD’s earnings growth is expected to slow down over the next 18 months before accelerating again in 2023. Over the next 12 months , AMD’s earnings growth is expected to be in line with the broader market and the semiconductor industry. NasdaqGS:AMD Earnings and Revenue Growth September 28th 2021\\n\\nIf earnings and revenue growth remains below 15% over the next 12 to 18 months, as analysts expect, it’s likely to weigh on sentiment, and limit upside for the share price. AMD is trading on a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, which is twice that of the average US stock. This typically implies that investors have higher expectations for a stock than for the broader market. If you believe forecasts will rise, that may not be a problem. However, given the cyclical nature of semiconductor stocks and the ongoing chip shortage, there may be some risk to expecting forecasts to rise.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nAMD’s prospects for the long term are strong, but the share has run hard in the last 18 months and medium term upside may be limited. In the past the share price has respected the 200-day moving average more often than not. This moving average is now at $90 and there is potential trendline support at $86. This area would imply a much smaller premium and a safer entry point for long term investors.\\n\\nYou can track analyst forecasts for AMD as well as any risks we identify on our  free AMD report  which is updated daily.\\n\\nIf you are no longer interested in Advanced Micro Devices, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\\n\\nSimply Wall St analyst Richard Bowman and Simply Wall St have no position in any of the companies mentioned.

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed at $100.35 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.15% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.16% gain on the day.\\n\\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 8.31% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.96% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.32% in that time.\\n\\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, AMD is projected to report earnings of $0.66 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 60.98%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.12 billion, up 47.06% from the year-ago period.\\n\\nAMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.50 per share and revenue of $15.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +93.8% and +60.43%, respectively.\\n\\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\\n\\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\\n\\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. AMD is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\\n\\nInvestors should also note AMD's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 40.57. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.38.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMeanwhile, AMD's PEG ratio is currently 0.91. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.52 as of yesterday's close.\\n\\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 154, putting it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.\\n\\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

       "  'title': '3 Reasons Why Advanced Micro (AMD) Is a Great Growth Stock',\n",
       "  'content': \"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\\n\\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\\n\\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\\n\\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this chipmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 101%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 136.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 56.9%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.7%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Advanced Micro have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAdvanced Micro has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination positions Advanced Micro well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'Can Advanced Micro (AMD) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?',\n",
       "  'content': \"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\\n\\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 17.42%, on average, in the last two quarters.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, Advanced Micro came out with earnings of $0.63 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.54 per share, representing a surprise of 16.67%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.52 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.18%.\\n\\nPrice and EPS Surprise\\n\\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Advanced Micro. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\\n\\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.31%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2021.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\\n\\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\\n\\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'AMD earnings preview: EPYC processor momentum to aid in growth',\n",
       "  'content': \"AMD (AMD) is set to report earnings Tuesday, Oct. 26, following the closing bell. Investors are hopeful that the California-based semiconductor company will produce another solid print amid the momentum in demand for AMD’s EPYC processors and semi-custom products.\\n\\nHere are the main metrics expected in AMD’s report based on Bloomberg consensus estimates:\\n\\nRevenue: $4.12 billion expected, $2.80 billion Y/Y Adjusted EPS: $0.67 expected, $0.52 Y/Y\\n\\nResults are expected to be aided by the increased adoption of EPYC processors by hyperscaling giants such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and HP (HPE). For instance, AMD processors are taking center stage in powering Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service.\\n\\nAMD’s stock has returned over 50% during the past year, more than 15% greater than the SPDR S&P 500’s (SPY) 33.5%. AMD shares have been on an uptrend since the beginning of the month in the lead-up to earnings following a cooldown from August to September.\\n\\nIndustry analysts reiterated their positive outlook for the company, specifically citing potential growth in adoption of AMD's EPYC 7003 series of high-performance microprocessors based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture, codenamed “Milan.”\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“From our channel checks and company commentary, hyperscalers/cloud providers are the first-movers in adopting Milan, but we expect that as enterprise spending recovers and customers gain more experience with the chip in a cloud setting, on-prem enterprise adoption of Milan is likely to follow over the next several years,” an Oct. 24 Goldman Sachs (GS) Equity Research report stated. “Coupled with the upcoming release of Genoa (next-generation server CPU based on the Zen 4 core architecture) in 2022, we reiterate our Buy rating for AMD and expect continued share gains for the foreseeable future.”\\n\\nIn terms of a short-term production and sales horizon in light of the global chip shortage, CEO Lisa Su believes that the current supply crunch is unlike anything the industry has seen before.\\n\\n“If you think about the semiconductor industry, we've always gone through cycles of ups and downs where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa,” Su said at Code Conference 2021 on Sept. 27. “This time it's different and what's different this time is every industry needs more, and so the confluence of that means that there is an imbalance.”\\n\\nAMD does not manufacture its chips in house. Instead, it outsources the production of its chips to foundries, or chip factories. According to Su, there is a “tremendous amount of investment” occurring in the industry, with more than 20 new factories expected to come online this year. In addition, there are another 20 more factories in the planning stage, and all of this in conjunction may help alleviate the chip shortage, Su said. And though she anticipates that the shortage will extend into 2022, she expects it to become less severe in the second half of next year.\\n\\nThis post will be updated with the results of AMD's Q3 results Tuesday after market close.

Gross margin was 48 percent, up over 400 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily driven by a richer mix of EPYC™, Ryzen™ and Radeon™ processor sales. Operating income was $948 million compared to operating income of $449 million a year ago and $831 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion compared to $525 million a year ago and $924 million in the prior quarter. Operating income improvements were primarily driven by higher revenue. Net income was $923 million compared to $390 million a year ago and $710 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $893 million compared to $501 million a year ago and $778 million in the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.75 compared to $0.32 a year ago and $0.58 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $0.41 a year ago and $0.63 in the prior quarter.

Cash from operations was $849 million compared to $339 million a year ago and $952 million in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $764 million compared to $265 million a year ago and $888 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter 2021 cash from operations and free cash flow included strategic investments in long-term supply chain capacity to support future revenue growth.\\n\\nQuarterly Financial Segment Summary\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nComputing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.4 billion, up 44 percent year-over-year and 7 percent quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were driven by higher Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct processor sales.\\n\\nClient processor average selling price (ASP) grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by a richer mix of Ryzen processor sales. GPU ASP grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by high-end Radeon graphics product sales and AMD Instinct data center GPU sales. Operating income was $513 million compared to $384 million a year ago and $526 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.9 billion, up 69 percent year-over-year and 20 percent quarter-over-quarter.

AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2021, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables at the end of this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of October 26, 2021 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision, equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also included acquisition-related costs for the three months ended September 25, 2021 and June 26, 2021. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.  ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.\\n\\nMedia Contact:\\r\\nDrew Prairie\\r\\nAMD Communications\\r\\n512-602-4425\\r\\ndrew.prairie@amd.com\\n\\nInvestor Contact:\\r\\nLaura Graves\\r\\nAMD Investor Relations\\r\\n408-749-5467\\r\\nlaura.graves@amd.com',\n",

AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2021, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 15%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables at the end of this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of October 26, 2021 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\\n\\nAMD, the AMD Arrow logo, EPYC, Radeon, Ryzen, AMD Instinct, Threadripper and combinations thereof, are trademarks of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision, equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company also included acquisition-related costs for the three months ended September 25, 2021 and June 26, 2021. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.\\n\\nMedia Contact:\\r\\nDrew Prairie\\r\\nAMD Communications\\r\\n512-602-4425\\r\\ndrew.prairie@amd.com\\n\\nInvestor Contact:\\r\\nLaura Graves\\r\\nAMD Investor Relations\\r\\n408-749-5467\\r\\nlaura.graves@amd.com',\n",

       "  'content': \"(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave a strong forecast indicating that market share gains, particularly in servers, are helping it make up for a tight supply of chips. Fourth-quarter revenue will be about $4.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, Santa Clara, California-based AMD said Tuesday in a statement. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $4.25 billion. The chipmaker is on course to exceed an earlier forecast and post a sales gain of 65% for 2021, it said.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nCities' Answer to Sprawl? Go Wild. Hamburg Is at the Heart of Germany’s Growing Dilemma Over China Why Americans and Britons Are Rushing to Buy Idyllic Homes in Italy One of California’s Wealthiest Counties Could Run Out of Water Next Summer The Coming Electric Car Disruption That Nobody’s Talking About\\n\\nUnder Chief Executive Offer Lisa Su, the 52-year-old company is experiencing one of its strongest periods, offering products that are the equal or surpass those of larger rival Intel Corp. AMD’s growth, relative to that of its competitor, indicates the company is gaining market share.\\n\\nData center sales in the period ended Sept. 25 more than doubled from a year earlier, AMD said in the statement.\\n\\n“Data center performed very well and we see strong demand,” Su said on an conference with analysts.\\n\\nWhile the company isn’t giving specific targets, AMD’s leader said she expects the demand environment to be strong in 2022. The PC market will be ‘flattish,’ Su said, held back by supply constraints of some parts while demand for video-game console chips will go up.\\n\\nIn addition to competing with Intel in processors for personal computers and servers that run the internet, AMD supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation. AMD’s Radeon chips compete with Nvidia Corp.’s GeForce line in the add-in graphics cards prized by PC gamers.\\n\\nAMD’s chips are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has surpassed Intel in production technology. TSMC also supplies Apple Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Nvidia and many other technology companies, and the Taiwanese company is struggling to keep up with demand. Last week, Intel reported revenue grew 5% in the third quarter. Its PC-related processor business sales declined around 2%. The world’s largest chipmaker’s data center business expanded 10% helped by demand from corporations. Revenue from hyperscalers -- the owners of large data centers that are the backbone of the internet -- dropped.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAMD reported third-quarter net income of $923 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with $390 million, or 32 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 54% to $4.31 billion.\\n\\nThe shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $122.93 in New York. The stock has gained 34% this year.\\n\\n(Updates with CEO comments beginning in the fifth paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nYou Could Be Competing With Bots to Buy Gifts This Christmas Colombia’s Rain Shaman Got Paid to Stop the Storms, Until He Couldn’t\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.66 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.61%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of 16.67%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $4.31 billion for the quarter ended September 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro shares have added about 33.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.6%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Advanced Micro?\\n\\nWhile Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.68 on $4.25 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.51 on $15.66 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Semiconductors is currently in the top 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Seems Overvalued and Large Players may Take Profits',\n",
       "  'content': \"This article was originally published on Simply Wall St News\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is clearly on a profit run, and the company is continuously surpassing expectations, which has led investors to pay more attention. In this article, we will examine if the stock price is too expensive in relation to the ability of AMD to produce future cash flows, and look at possible investment strategies that might occur.\\n\\nStarting with the most recent earnings report. We see that for the third quarter, the company reported sales was USD 4,313 million compared to USD 2,801 million a year ago. Net income was USD 923 million compared to USD 390 million a year ago.\\n\\nThe net income is the most important aspect, as it is what translates into cash flows attributable to investors. For AMD, this result has been superb for shareholders, and the company even issued guidance expecting to grow revenues around 65% for the full 2021 year.\\n\\nInvestors have responded to the success of AMD, and the stock has risen by 60% over the last year. However, becoming bigger is harder than becoming big and the recent stock growth falls short of the 78% return per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\\n\\nAMD Fair Value\\n\\nNext, we will see if the future cash flows attributable to investors justify the current stock price. For this we will use our Discounted Cash Flow valuation model.\\n\\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method.For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\\n\\nBy using our model, we get two crucial results. The present value of the future cash flows and the present value of the terminal value - present value is only an attempt to estimate how much are future earnings worth today.\\n\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37b\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$136b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$70b\\n\\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$107b.\\n\\nFinally, we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.Relative to the current share price of US$122, the company appears reasonably expensiveat the time of writing. dcf\\n\\nOur model has a built-in safety margin of 10% on either side that accounts for possible errors in value estimation. It seems that currently AMD stock has a fair value of US$88 per share, but is trading some 40% above that. The market may be overestimating the future growth potential of the company, and the current price is a reflection of optimistic sentiment more than the fundamentals.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFor existing shareholders, this can be an opportunity to cycle funds elsewhere, as some holders might decide to take their gains and the stock can move back to equilibrium. The goal of investing is to sell high, and even when business is going great, experienced investors might decide to capitalize on their investments, instead of participating in riskier price movements.\\n\\nIf, however, the company finds new growth ventures and innovation, the price can be argued to be justified.\\n\\nFor people that are considering becoming shareholders, it will be good to take a deeper dive into the details, and look for places where the company might be able to unlock valueover and above what is currently implied.\\n\\nThere is no question that AMD is a great and successful company, however when buying, we must also be mindful not to overpay for great things.\\n\\nNext Steps:\\n\\nFor Advanced Micro Devices, we've put together threefundamentalaspectsyou should further examine:\\n\\nRisks: Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Advanced Micro Devices  you should know about.

       "  'title': 'Why AMD and Nvidia Are Both Better Buys Than Intel Stock',\n",
       "  'content': 'Not long ago, the trio of chip stocks to watch was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While Nvidia and AMD had explosive gains in the past, the hope was that INTC stock could capitalize as well. Quantum computing stocks: Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\\n\\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nThat hope hasn’t come to fruition though.\\n\\nOver the past year, AMD and Nvidia are up 35% and 90%, respectively. Both dominate INTC stock, which was up just 1.5% before earnings. After reporting on Oct. 22 though, the stock is down 3% for the year. Heck, even the broader market crushes Intel’s performance.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nThe further out in time we go, the worse it gets. In the last three years, Intel is up 6%. But that badly lags Nvidia’s 400% gain and AMD’s 600% ascent. Let’s not bother going out to the five-year window, where both AMD and NVDA’s gains top 1,300%.\\n\\nThe question isn’t “Has Intel been better?” Instead it’s “Is Intel a better buy?”\\n\\nUnfortunately for longs, I don’t think the answer is any different. Both turn out to be “no.”\\n\\nBreaking Down Intel\\n\\nIt’s been one blow after the other. Intel’s chips simply aren’t what they used to be and others – namely Nvidia and AMD – are leaving it in the dust. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is moving away from Intel’s chips for its Macs in favor of its own silicon.\\n\\nThen Intel’s own issues with its 7nm chips last summer is what allowed AMD to gain even more ground. Put simply, AMD is eating Intel’s lunch and its margins are flying higher in the process.\\n\\n7 of the Best Dividend Stocks for Passive Income\\n\\nAnalysts have been insanely wrong on their estimates for Nvidia. In fact, the same can be said for AMD. In both cases, analysts have been way too conservative. As a result, we’ve seen revenue expectations climb by billions of dollars over the last few quarters.\\n\\nFor Intel, analysts were actually too aggressive, which is a disaster for the stock price.\\n\\nComing into the year, analysts were expecting just over $75 billion in revenue for Intel this year. While that estimate dipped to as low as $71 billion, it now sits at about $73.75 billion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut do you see the problem? There’s no momentum. No upside surprises. No “we’re doing so good we’re blowing away estimates and raising our guidance.” There’s just no excitement here and the stock’s 6.5% year-to-date loss highlights as much.\\n\\nGrowth Lacks vs Nvidia and AMD\\n\\nIn reality, consensus estimates have been pretty accurate for Intel. If the company reports in-line results, it will translate to a 5.5% decline in sales this year and a 0.7% dip next year. On the earnings front, that translates to an earnings decline of 9.6% and 7.7% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n\\nIn 2023, estimates currently call for 5.4% growth. However, there’s a few problems with that.\\n\\nFirst, it’s an estimate several years into the future and is subject to being wrong. Second, it’s likely woefully short of what AMD and NVDA will do in the future. For what it’s worth, current estimates call for roughly 13% revenue growth in 2023 for both companies, respectively.\\n\\nThird and lastly, even if Intel does generate 5.4% growth, it will mean $77.08 billion in revenue. While that’s a sizable sum, it’s still short of the company’s 2020 revenue figure of $77.87 billion.\\n\\nAdmittedly, INTC stock is cheaper than AMD and Nvidia, trading at just 11.5x this year’s earnings. But without another reason to buy the stock, the valuation alone isn’t enough of a catalyst.\\n\\nTrading INTC Stock Daily chart of INTC stock\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nAbove is a multi-year look at INTC stock via a weekly chart. For the most part, Intel has done a pretty good job riding the 200-week moving average higher. The exception is the coronavirus correction in early 2020.\\n\\nJust about every stock broke down at that point, so it’s hard to fault Intel. I don’t.\\n\\nINTC stock was doing a great job riding the 200-week and 50-month moving averages higher. However, the stock is breaking below these measures after a bearish post-earnings reaction.\\n\\nIt’s also rotating below this month’s prior low, now near $48 at the time of this writing.

       "  'title': 'The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet, AMD, Texas Instruments, and Teradyne',\n",
       "  'content': 'For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL – October 28, 2021 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, and Teradyne, Inc. TER.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nA Big Day for Tech Earnings\\n\\nWe generally think of the big tech names as growth stocks, and they are, going by the way they continue to grow year upon year. But when big tech is relatively undervalued, it’s a really great time to invest. Because this segment really offers the quality of earnings that value investors are looking for.\\n\\nThe best thing about tech is the way it helps increase efficiencies across other sectors, meaning that it doesn’t just grow because of dynamics within the industry but also as a result of overall economic growth across industries. And that is why I have always been in favor of a tech weighting in the portfolio.\\n\\nOver time, tech stocks tend to appreciate really well. In the last 20 years, the tech sector gained 545.4% compared to 383.8% for the S&P 500. It also outgrew the S&P in the last 10 years at 382.4%/310.3%. The differential only increased in recent history: 178.5% to the S&P’s 125.0% in the last five years, 118.6% to 78.2% in the last three years, and so on.\\n\\nThis quarter, it was Microsoft’s Nadella that also mentioned how tech tends to be “deflationary”: “Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses – small and large – can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building tech intensity.” The idea being that since technology helps increase efficiencies, you would need less of the more expensive resources (because of inflation), so you wouldn’t need to pass on these costs to the consumer.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAnother factor that’s often overlooked is the fact that tech companies tend to return a ton of cash to investors. Not all tech companies will pay dividends of course, since there is tremendous scope for higher returns by reinvesting the cash in the business.\\n\\nBut almost all tech companies buy back a lot of shares. That’s because they tend to hire more engineering talent that’s often paid with stock-based compensation. Since this increases the share count, most tech companies regularly buy back a ton of shares.\\n\\nSo there are many good reasons to invest in tech, especially the big ones that just reported earnings results-\\n\\nMicrosoft Corp.\\n\\nMicrosoft topped earnings estimates by 10.2% and revenue estimates by 3.3%.\\n\\nStrength was broad-based across segments and product lines: the largest segment Intelligent Cloud grew 31% with the server side jumping 35% and Azure and other services up 50%; Productivity and Business Processes grew 22% with office commercial and consumer both up double-digits, LinkedIn up 42% and Dynamics up 31%; More Personal Computing increased 12% with the Windows side growing low double-digits, search and advertising up 40%, Xbox content and services a seasonally soft 2% while the Surface category declined.\\n\\nThe results display the success of the company’s cloud strategy, its clout at legacy customers who are leveraging its hybrid system to jump to the cloud, the continued strength in digitization even as markets open up, a strong job market that’s pushing LinkedIn revenue, the platform approach that continues to pull more users into its productivity ecosystem and strong AI tools that helps it create more sticky platforms and sell ads.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company looks very strong and well positioned to make the most of ongoing digitization and other trends with growth rates likely to remain elevated as it continues to take share in the cloud.\\n\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n\\nAlphabet reported a revenue beat of 3.5% and earnings beat of 21.0%.\\n\\nThe company’s 45% cloud revenue growth was almost as strong as Microsoft’s, albeit off a much smaller base. Alphabet continues to add to its capabilities and since this is a very big opportunity with not necessarily a single winner, we should expect continued growth here.\\n\\nThe company’s bread and butter is of course search advertising, which remains robust as some areas of the economy (like travel and retail) that were hit by the pandemic last year comes back online. Apple’s privacy initiative has impacted the quarter’s results, but there are many other offsetting factors, not the least of which is the fact that some ad spending likely moved to more easily measurable Google platforms from Apple platforms.\\n\\nEven YouTube, which is particularly susceptible to Apple’s changes, grew 43% on the year on the back of more than 50 million music and premium subscribers. That has to count for something!\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank #2 company grows like a youngster but spills cash like a granddaddy. That situation is unlikely to change at any time in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\\n\\nAMD’s revenue beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7% while its earnings beat by 10.6%.\\n\\nIt was a stupendous quarter from AMD, which grew revenue 54% (the fifth quarter in a row of 50%+ increases), gross profit 70%, operating income 111% and EPS 134%. Both reporting segments grew strong double-digits: Computing and Graphics up 44% and the slightly smaller Enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment up 69%. Data center sales more than doubled.\\n\\nAMD’s premium business is picking up across consumer, gaming and commercial markets and high-volume deployments across media and entertainment, engineering, architecture, and automotive verticals continues. The positive mix shift supports stronger margins.\\n\\nThe Zacks Rank #2 company should continue growing strongly as it enjoys a design edge that it wrested from Intel, and that is very hard to outdo in a few years’ time. So it’s easy to see why revenue growth guidance for the year was raised from 60% to 65% with gross margin remaining at the 48% level reached in Q3.\\n\\nOther tech companies that also reported yesterday were-\\n\\n#2 ranked Texas Instruments Inc., which reported in-line earnings on revenue that missed by 1.1%.\\n\\n#2 ranked Teradyne, Inc., which reported an earnings beat of 9.7% on revenue that was essentially in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\\n\\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\\n\\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $2.4 trillion by 2028 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They’re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.\\n\\nZacks has just released Century of Biology: 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance.

       "  'title': 'Bull of the Day: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)',\n",
       "  'content': 'Advanced Micro Devices AMD delivered another great beat-and-raise quarter last week and inspired analysts to once again boost their estimates and price targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q3 results released October 26, the chip-maker reported non-GAAP earnings of 73 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.6%. The bottom line soared 78% year over year and 16% sequentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues of $4.31 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7% and surged 54% year over year. On a sequential basis, the top line increased 12%.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobust performance from the Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segments drove the year-over-year improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD also raised its 2021 guidance for revenues on the back of strong growth across all businesses. So while this year\\'s topline rebound of +65% growth slows down to just +16.5% next year, the business momentum implies next year\\'s numbers will rise from current estimates.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy I\\'ve Been Pounding the Table on AMD Since $75\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m going to share more details about this fantastic growth -- plus a bandwagon full of analyst reactions -- but first let me explain why I was telling everyone who would listen this past spring to buy AMD at $75.\\r\\n\\r\\nEssentially, it was all about how well CEO Lisa Su and her teams were executing in the dynamic, cutting-edges of semiconductor innovation, just like my favorite GPU-maker NVIDIA NVDA.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlus, not only was she eating Intel\\'s lunch at every turn in PCs and notebooks with sub-10 nanometer technology, the stock was consistently trading at half the valuation of NVDA.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven today, AMD is trading for under 8 times next year\\'s projected sales of $18.8 billion while NVDA leaves the atmosphere (for chips) at over 21X sales!\\r\\n\\r\\nSee an excellent primer on the victory over Intel here...\\r\\n\\r\\nRelease the Ryzen! AMD Roars in the Nanometer Wars\\r\\n\\r\\nI only wish I had listened to my own advice better during the recent 7% Nasdaq correction where I sold some AMD shares near $110 and then thought I could get back in under $95.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lol\" was heard from true AMD bulls as the stock found strong support near $100 and then surged to new highs above $120 even before their stellar report last week.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet that be a horse-trading lesson about superior growth franchises with big TAMs (total addressable markets) in multiple areas of technology, from mobile, gaming, and computing to automotive, enterprise/data, and industrial -- to say nothing of super-computers for scientific, military and government research institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, don\\'t look gift horses in the mouth at 6X or even 8X sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenue Segment Growth Details\\r\\n\\r\\nComputing and Graphics segment revenues of $2.4 billion increased 44% year over year and 7% sequentially. The upside can be attributed to higher Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct processor sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in client processor average selling price (“ASP”) was driven by a favorable mix of Ryzen processor sales. GPU ASP growth in the reported quarter was driven by high-end Radeon graphics product sales and AMD Instinct data center GPU sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD partnered with Microsoft MSFT to bring powerful, reliable computing to users with Windows 11, powered by Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyzen processors witnessed strong customer adoption with Lenovo starting shipments of the Thinkbook and Thinkpad E series business laptops featuring Windows 11. Lenovo also announced Yoga Slim 7 Carbon and Yoga Slim 7 Pro. HP released two AiO devices with Ryzen processors and ASUS unveiled the Ryzen 5000 Series-based Zenbook, Zenbook PRO, ProArtStudioBook and VivoBook.\\r\\n\\r\\nAMD launched Ryzen 5000 G-Series Desktop Processors with Radeon Graphics and Radeon RX 6600 XT graphics card in the reported quarter. The company also announced the availability of the Radeon PRO W6000X series GPUs for Mac Pro.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenues of $1.90 billion were up 69% year over year and 20% sequentially. The year-over-year increase can be attributed to higher semi-custom product sales and EPYC processor revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPYC’s adoption rate continued to increase in the reported quarter. Argonne National Labs selected AMD EPYC processors to power a new supercomputer known as Polaris. Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud announced the public preview of N2D Virtual Machines powered by AMD EPYC7003 Series processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company announced that second-generation AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Radeon Pro V520 GPUs will power new sizes for Amazon EC2 G4 ad instances.\\r\\n\\r\\nCloudflare NET selected third-generation AMD EPYC processors for its 11th generation servers that power the company’s DNS network.\\r\\n\\r\\nLisa Su Finally Wins Over Reluctant WS Analysts\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst let\\'s present the analysts, in order, who most deserve praise for correctly seeing the prize that we saw in the first half, when we maintained a steady bias to buy under $80.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let\\'s also note that most of their \"old\" price targets around $120 came after the Q2 report in late July -- and well after we were telling everyone we knew (my son and daughter-in-law included) to buy at $75 in March through May.\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferies: Analyst Mark Lipacis has been one of the biggest and oldest bulls on NVDA and so he knows the worth of AMD as well as anyone. He raised his price target to $145 (from $127) as he estimates AMD gained 280 basis points of Server CPU revenue hare in Q3 and about 180 basis points in CPU unit share.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AMD quarter raises his conviction in his thesis that AMD\\'s server share gains can accelerate to 200-300 points per quarter from 50-100 points per quarter. Lipacis believes AMD\\'s next gen Zen-4 server will extend its lead and he looks forward to the company\\'s Data Center event on Nov 8 as being the next catalyst for the stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusquehanna: Analyst Christopher Rolland raised his price target to $145 (from $130) citing solid quarterly results and business outlook which allowed the company to raise their full year guidance. He said although supply constraints provided headwinds, the company\\'s profitability is still being underestimated by many investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWells Fargo: Analyst Aaron Rakers raised his price target on AMD to $145 (from $120) and while noting he would not be surprised to see AMD shares take a pause after the ramp into the Q3 print, he thinks the company\\'s momentum remains strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig-Hallum: Analyst Christian Schwab raised his price target on AMD to $150 (from $120) on \"yet another impressive quarter\" and raised expectations. The analyst notes AMD continues to see strength broadly across its business, reporting better-than-expected results and guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiper Sandler: Analyst Harsh Kumar raised his price target on AMD to $140 (from $120) noting that AMD reported solid September quarter results and provided December quarter guidance ahead of expectations. Kumar expects servers to \"grow nicely\" in 2022, and thinks semi-custom should continue to grow in the third year of the console cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaymond James: Analyst Chris Caso raised his price target on AMD to $140 (from $110) and noted that the quarter \"once again demonstrated a marked contrast with Intel\\'s report.\" Caso estimates AMD has now gained 6 points of server share since earlier this year, and AMD is not experiencing the China weakness Intel mentioned on their call, he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarclays: Analyst Blayne Curtis raised his price target on AMD to $135 (from $120) and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. While supply constraints limits upside into Q4, 2022 should be \"another strong year\" as AMD reloads on capacity \"with clear leadership in Servers likely to push share above 20%,\" Curtis tells investors in a research note.\\r\\n\\r\\nMizuho: Analyst Vijay Rakesh raised his price target on AMD to $135 (from $110) and observed that Intel\\'s recent accelerated foundry pivot could provide further share gains in server for AMD. He\\'s probably referring to Global Foundries -- which finally went public today at a $26 billion valuation under ticker GFS -- and how long it might take INTC to get any traction in sub-10nm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here was the lone, reluctant bull...\\r\\n\\r\\nCiti: Analyst Christopher Danely raised his price target on AMD to $125 (from $100) but reiterates a Neutral rating on the shares. AMD reported a \"strong\" Q3 due to strength from the data center and gaming end markets and guided Q4 above consensus due to the continuing share gains in servers. But Danely keeps a Neutral rating on the shares due to valuation and PC end market demand \"cooling off from post-COVID normalcy returning and supply issues.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line: Keep looking for dips to buy in NVDA and AMD. And be sure to revisit my Technology Super Cycle thesis by going to Twitter @KevinBCook and joining the greatest debate I started in 2017 about how Innovation Trounces Inflation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure: I own shares of NVDA and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'What Makes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?',\n",
       "  'content': 'Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock\\'s recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the \\'long\\' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\\n\\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\\n\\nBelow, we take a look at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Advanced Micro Devices currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\\n\\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\\n\\nSet to Beat the Market?\\n\\nLet\\'s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMD that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\\n\\nLooking at a stock\\'s short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It\\'s also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFor AMD, shares are up 0.34% over the past week while the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is up 2.42% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.35% compares favorably with the industry\\'s 4.34% performance as well.\\n\\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices have increased 9.19% over the past quarter, and have gained 59.69% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.53% and 40.97%, respectively.\\n\\nInvestors should also take note of AMD\\'s average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AMD is averaging 44,437,240 shares for the last 20 days.\\n\\nEarnings Outlook\\n\\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with AMD.\\n\\nOver the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMD\\'s consensus estimate, increasing from $2.50 to $2.65 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AMD is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A.

On the other hand, there were a total of 51 hedge funds with a bullish position in AMD a year ago. With the smart money\\'s positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists an \"upper tier\" of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were upping their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions). Is AMD A Good Stock To Buy?\\n\\nAccording to publicly available hedge fund and institutional investor holdings data compiled by Insider Monkey, Citadel Investment Group, managed by Ken Griffin, holds the largest position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Citadel Investment Group has a $1.6468 billion call position in the stock, comprising 0.4% of its 13F portfolio. Coming in second is Fisher Asset Management, managed by Ken Fisher, which holds a $941.3 million position; 0.6% of its 13F portfolio is allocated to the stock.

Sylebra Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, setting aside 10.42 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to AMD.\\n\\nWith a general bullishness amongst the heavyweights, some big names have been driving this bullishness.

(NASDAQ:AMD). These stocks are Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).

That figure was $4610 million in AMD\\'s case. Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is the least popular one with only 20 bullish hedge fund positions. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for AMD is 60.6. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 26.3% in 2021 through October 29th and still beat the market by 2.3 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on AMD as the stock returned 28% since the end of the second quarter (through 10/29) and outperformed the market by an even larger margin.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\\n\\nSuggested Articles:\\n\\n11 Best Oil Tanker Stocks To Buy Now 12 Countries That Produce The Most Cars 15 Fastest Growing Beverage Brands in 2020\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

       "  'content': 'By Supantha Mukherjee\\n\\nLISBON (Reuters) - Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices has been able to skirt most of the problems linked with the global chip supply shortage by forecasting demand years in advance, a top executive said on Tuesday.\\n\\nDemand for electronics gadgets from people stuck in homes due to the pandemic has led to a shortage of semiconductors that are used from anything from mobile phones and cars.\\n\\nBut despite a squeeze in supply, AMD has been able to take market share away from rival Intel in both PCs and servers with its latest line of processors.\\n\\n\"Our supply chain team has worked to make sure that we have months and years of forecast ahead into our supply chain,\" Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said on the sidelines of the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.\\n\\n\"Everybody has had to increase their focus on the supply chain but we did so from the very beginning of the pandemic.\" Companies with existing ties with chip fabrication companies like Taiwan\\'s TSMC were also able to guarantee a steady supply. AMD, which doesn\\'t manufacture its own chips like Intel, depends on companies such as TSMC and GlobalFoundries to make the chips for them.\\n\\n\"We are using cutting edge semiconductor nodes and we are a very large purchaser in this area, so that is certainly helpful in securing our supply chain,\" Papermaster said.\\n\\nContrary to automakers, who are hardest hit by semiconductor shortage, AMD focuses on the smaller, more advanced chips which are less affected than the supply of mass-produced older chips.AMD has been focusing on high-margin chips, which not only allows the company to channel its resources but increases revenue, projected to rise 65% this year.\\n\\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Lisbon; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Sandra Maler)',\n",

       "  'content': 'On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 hit new all-time highs and there were plenty of big movers in the mix. With that in mind, let’s take a look at some top stock trades now.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nI have been watching and waiting on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) for days now. The stock rallied hard into earnings and bulls were riding this one following a weekly-up rotation a few weeks ago.\\n\\nHowever, after such a strong run, we needed to stalk this one with some patience — and that patience has finally paid off.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nI had AMD on watch as shares were gapping lower in Monday’s pre-market trading session. The stock gave us the exact dip we were looking for, opening near the 10-day moving average. Now ripping higher, AMD stock has given us a daily-up rotation too, while trying to clear the prior high, near $122.50.\\n\\nIf it can do that, it can challenge the $127 to $128 area. Above that area likely opens the door the 161.8% extension near $137.\\n\\n7 Retail Stocks to Buy Regardless of Supply Shortages\\n\\nOn the downside, however, a break of $120 — or worse, this week’s low — could put the $115 area and the 21-day moving average in play.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Tesla (TSLA) Daily chart of TSLA\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is ripping again on Monday, up more than 8% to more new all-time highs. With a market capitalization well over $1 trillion, it’s one of the most valuable companies in the world.\\n\\nSorry bears, overvalued or not, this stock has been an absolute monster. This is why we do not fight trends.\\n\\nIn any regard, shares gapped higher by about 8.5% on the day, but on the pullback, Tesla stock respected the prior all-time high (from Friday) and the 161.8% extension. These measures combined as support as shares now press higher toward $1,200. That mark is one of my upside targets, although $1,193.50 is pretty darn close.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAt some point, TSLA stock will need a rest, in which case, we’ll be looking to see how it holds up near the eight-day and 10-day moving averages. On the upside, over $1,200 could put $1,250 to $1,260 in play, because with Tesla, you just never really know how far it can run. I know many were looking for this train to stop at $1,000 if it could get there.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Lucid Motors (LCID) Top stock trades for LCID\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nWhile we just talked aboutLucidMotors (NASDAQ:LCID) last week, the action begs for further discussion.\\n\\nThe stock was up as much as 8.6% earlier in the day. However, shares of LCID stock actually finished down 1.2%on Monday. Simply put, $40 and the 50% retracement continue to reject the stock.\\n\\nOn the plus side, we have an inside day forming, with a nice two-day low at $35.43. A break of this level opens up more downside and should have bulls shifting to a more cautious state until LCID stock finds it footing.\\n\\n7 Penny Stocks With the Potential to 10X in 2022\\n\\nOn the upside, though, if shares can clear $40.50 and the recent high at $41.60, it could put the 61.8% retracement on the table.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: GameStop (GME) Top stock trades for GME\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is finally making some noise again after going quiet for quite some time.\\n\\nThe stock has been forming a solid wedge lately, marked by a series of higher lows and lower highs. However, it has held up above its 200-day moving average and is now clearing its other key moving averages and VWAP measures.\\n\\nCurrently above $200, bulls are looking for more. That’s as it goes daily-, weekly- and monthly-up in Monday’s session, all while clearing wedge resistance. The action is quite impressive.\\n\\nFrom here, let’s see how GME stock handles the $216 to $220 area. Above this zone opens the door to the third-quarter high at $231.44. Above that, and $250 is on the table, along with the 61.8% retracement of the current range near $268.50.\\n\\nWhile I would typically apologize for so throwing so many levels out there, you never really know with a stock like GameStop, which could hit all of them in a few days — or less.\\n\\nOn the downside, however, it’s okay if GME stock doesn’t hold the VWAP measure or $200. But we don’t want to see it lose the 20-day and 50-day moving averages from here.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'content': 'For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\\n\\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\\n\\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\\n\\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\\n\\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\\n\\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\\n\\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\\n\\nValue Score\\n\\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock\\'s true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\\n\\nGrowth Score\\n\\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock\\'s future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\\n\\nMomentum Score\\n\\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock\\'s price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nVGM Score\\n\\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It\\'s also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\\n\\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\\n\\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company\\'s earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\\n\\nIt\\'s highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That\\'s more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\\n\\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\\n\\nThat\\'s where the Style Scores come in.\\n\\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you\\'ll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you\\'re looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it\\'s important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\\n\\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock\\'s earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\\n\\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\\n\\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\\n\\nStock to Watch: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market on the back of its evolution as an enterprise-focus company from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider. AMD has emerged as a strong challenger to NVIDIA’s dominance in the graphic processing unit or GPU market based on its Radeon technology.\\n\\nAMD is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\\n\\nMomentum investors should take note of this Computer and Technology stock. AMD has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 25.4% over the past four weeks.\\n\\n13 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2021, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.15 to $2.65 per share. AMD also boasts an average earnings surprise of 14%.\\n\\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, AMD should be on investors\\' short list.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. ceded more than 2 percentage points of market share to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in the third quarter, marking another setback for a chip pioneer that has lost some of its technology edge.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nChina’s Climate Goals Hinge on a $440 Billion Nuclear Buildout Supply Chain Crisis Risks Taking the Global Economy Down With It Results on Key Ballot Initiatives, From Policing to the Environment Atlanta’s Crowded Election Pits Former Mayor Versus ‘Anyone But’ ‘Airbnb Queen’ Says She’s Caught Up in Platform’s New York Feud\\n\\nAMD accounted for 24.6% of personal-computer processor sales in the third quarter, up from 22.5% a year earlier, according to Mercury Research. The shift was accelerated by a steep drop in demand for chips used to power low-end notebooks such as the Chromebook, which rely on Intel processors.\\n\\nIntel still has 75% of the market for PC processors and remains the world’s biggest chipmaker. But AMD has eroded its dominance, especially in the market for higher-end computing.\\n\\nIntel also is suffering a post-pandemic hangover. When lockdowns and quarantines forced students and office staff to work from home last year, many snapped up Chromebooks with Intel processors. Now that many have gone back to in-person school and work, there’s less demand for those devices.\\n\\n“The low end of the notebook and Chromebook market evaporated,” Mercury analyst Dean McCarron said in a report.\\n\\nAMD and Intel are the sole providers of so-called X86 processors, the chips at the heart of the majority of the world’s laptop and desktop computers, as well as most of the server machines that run the internet and corporate networks. AMD has been making steady gains in the market, helped both by new products and delays by Intel in improving its manufacturing.\\n\\nAMD has limited exposure to the low-end Chromebook market, and it made advances in the most lucrative part of the industry last quarter, seizing more than 10% of the server processor market.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSeparately, the portion of the market served by processors made using Arm Ltd. technology also shrank, hurt by the lower Chromebook demand. That decline was offset somewhat by increasing sales from Apple Inc., which has shifted more of its computer offerings to its own chips, based on Arm technology, Mercury said.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nPapa John Is Still Obsessed With Papa John’s All Those 23andMe Spit Tests Were Part of a Bigger Plan The Amazon Is Fast Approaching a Point of No Return Big Teacher Is Watching: How AI Spyware Took Over Schools The Slip-and-Fall King Wants to Save You From Your Next Wipeout\\n\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Stocks again forged to all-time highs on Wednesday. The move came after the Fed said it would not raise interest rates, but would begin a gradual taper. It was enough to spur stocks higher after the news. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) Daily chart of SHIB-USD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TradingView\\n\\nShiba Inu (CCC:SHIB-USD) remains at the forefront of cryptocurrency investors’ radar, as it gives us a bull flag consolidation pattern after a monstrous rally.\\n\\nWe were looking for the upside move, but I’ll be honest, I did not expect such a robust rally in such a short period of time. The setup gets interesting now, though.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nAs SHIB dips down into its 10-day moving average, bulls are curious whether it will act as support. However, perhaps more important is the 0.0000573 level. A break of that mark could quickly put the 21-week moving average in play.\\n\\n7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for Q4 Earnings Season\\n\\nOn the upside, though, clearing wedge resistance could put the high in play at 0.0000887. Over that opens the door to the 261.8% extension near 0.0000965.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Top stock trades for AMD\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nWhat a beast Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). As much as I hate beating the same drum so often, it’s hard to keep the winners off our list of go-to stocks.\\n\\nWe were buyers of AMD after patiently waiting for a retest of the 10-day moving average near $119. Three days later, and the stock is north of $130 and above the post-earnings highs.\\n\\nIf it can stay above $127 — and ideally, $130 — the 161.8% extension could be on the table near $136.50.\\n\\nOn the downside, however, a break of $127 could put the 10-day moving average back in play, along with the $122.50 level.\\n\\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Coinbase (COIN) Top stock trades for COIN\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has been an awesome long holding lately, with shares exploding over the $294 level, then holding this level on the dip.\\n\\nNow climbing, the 61.8% retracement acted as resistance on Tuesday. If Coinbase can take this level out and clear $350, it should open the door for a possible push to the 78.6% retracement to the $380 to $383 area.\\n\\n6 of the Hottest Stocks to Pick Up for Less Than $1\\n\\nOn the downside, though, let’s see how the 10-day moving average does as support. Below it could put the $294 breakout level back in play.\\n\\nTop Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Ford (F) Top stock trades for F\\n\\nClick to Enlarge\\n\\nSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider\\n\\nLast but not least is another favorite: Ford (NYSE:F). Shares continue to boom to multi-year highs as the company continues to deliver good news.\\n\\nAhead of earnings, Ford stock endured a four-day decline. It then gapped above the prior 2021 high at $16.45. Since then, Ford hasn’t given bulls even day in the red.\\n\\nShares cleared our first target near $17.50 are now approaching the 161.8% extension of the current range, near $19. Above that, and $20 is the next “obvious” target, but Ford will eventually need a rest.\\n\\nLike Coinbase, I want to see how Ford holds up on a test of the 10-day moving average. That did not go over so well ahead of earnings, but I think it will do better this time around.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

       "  'content': \"Investors interested in Electronics - Semiconductors stocks are likely familiar with ASE Technology Hldg (ASX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\\n\\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\\n\\nBoth ASE Technology Hldg and Advanced Micro Devices have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\\n\\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\\n\\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\\n\\nASX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.07, while AMD has a forward P/E of 57.48. We also note that ASX has a PEG ratio of 0.37. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24.\\n\\nAnother notable valuation metric for ASX is its P/B ratio of 1.86. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMD has a P/B of 25.80.\\n\\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ASX's Value grade of A and AMD's Value grade of D.\\n\\nBoth ASX and AMD are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ASX is the superior value option right now.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Advanced Micro (AMD) Now',\n",
       "  'content': \"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\\n\\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\\n\\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\\n\\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\\n\\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\\n\\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this chipmaker a great growth pick right now.\\n\\nEarnings Growth\\n\\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\\n\\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Advanced Micro is 104.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 105.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 39.1%.\\n\\nCash Flow Growth\\n\\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Advanced Micro is 97%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 16.9%.\\n\\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 49.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.7%.\\n\\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\\n\\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Advanced Micro. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.2% over the past month.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Advanced Micro a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nThis combination indicates that Advanced Micro is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
